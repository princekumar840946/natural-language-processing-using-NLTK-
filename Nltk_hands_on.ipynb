it was very still for a long time.', 'At last, there came a little\\r\\nrustling, whispering sound, all round the window: _rustle, whisper,\\r\\nwhisper_.', '\"Who is there?\"', 'said the little

other flowers were to be seen;\\r\\nbut she had the birds to sing to her and the sun to shine upon her\\r\\npretty yellow head.', 'She was so pleased, too, when the children exclaimed\\r\\nwith pleasure that now they knew that the beautiful spring had come!', 'THE COCK-A-DOO-DLE-DOO\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA very little boy made this story up \"out of his head,\" and told it to\\r\\nhis papa.', 'I

poor\\r\\npeople of the earth working and suffering in the hot fields, while she\\r\\nherself floated on the morning breeze, hither and thither, without a\\r\\ncare.', '\"Oh, if I could only help the poor people down there!\"', 'she thought.', '\"If\\r\\nI could but make their work easier, or give the hungry ones food, or the\\r\\nthirsty a drink!\"', 'And as the day passed, and the Cloud became larger, this wish to do\\r\\nsomething for the people of earth was ever greater in her heart.', 'On earth it grew hotter and hotter; the sun burned down so fiercely that\\r\\nthe people were fainting in its rays; it seemed as if they must die of\\r\\nheat, and yet they were obliged to go on with their work, for they were\\r\\nvery poor.', 'Sometimes they stood and looked up at the Cloud, as if they\\r\\nwere praying, and saying, \"Ah, if you could help us!\"', '\"I will help you; I will!\"', 'said the Cloud.', 'And she began to sink softly\\r\\ndown toward the earth.', 'But suddenly, as she floated down, she remembered something which had\\r\\nbeen told her when she was a tiny Cloud-child, in the lap of Mother\\r\\nOcean: it had been whispered that if the Clouds go too near the earth\\r\\nthey die.', 'When she remembered this she held herself from sinking, and\\r\\nswayed here and there on the breeze, thinking,--thinking.', 'But at last\\r\\nshe stood quite still, and spoke boldly and proudly.', 'She said, \"Men of\\r\\nearth, I will help you, come what may!\"', 'The thought made her suddenly marvellously big and strong and powerful.', 'Never had she dreamed that she could be so big.', 'Like a mighty angel of\\r\\nblessing she stood above the earth, and lifted her head and spread her\\r\\nwings far over the fields and woods.', 'She was so great, so majestic, that\\r\\nmen and animals were awe-struck at the sight; the trees and the grasses\\r\\nbowed before her; yet all the earth-creatures felt that she meant them\\r\\nwell.', '\"Yes, I will help you,\" cried the Cloud once more.', '\"Take me to\\r\\nyourselves; I will give my life for you!\"', 'As she said the words a wonderful light glowed from her heart, the sound\\r\\nof thunder rolled through the sky, and a love greater than words can\\r\\ntell filled the Cloud; down, down, close to the earth she swept, and\\r\\ngave up her life in a blessed, healing shower of rain.', \"That rain was the Cloud's great deed; it was her death, too; but it was\\r\\nalso her glory.\", 'Over the whole country-side, as far as the rain fell, a\\r\\nlovely rainbow sprang its arch, and all the brightest rays of heaven\\r\\nmade its colours; it was the last greeting of a love so great that it\\r\\nsacrificed itself.', 'Soon that, too, was gone, but long, long afterward the men and animals\\r\\nwho were saved by the Cloud kept her blessing in their hearts.', 'THE LITTLE RED HEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little Red Hen was in the farmyard with her chickens, when she found\\r\\na grain of wheat.', '\"Who

wheat was ripe she said, \"Who will take this wheat to the\\r\\nmill?\"', '\"Not I,\" said the Goose.', '\"Not I,\" said the Duck.', '\"I will, then,\" said the little Red Hen, and she took the wheat to the\\r\\nmill.', 'When she brought the flour home she said, \"Who will make some bread with\\r\\nthis flour?\"', '\"Not I,\" said the Goose.', '\"Not I,\" said the Duck.', '\"I will, then,\" said the little Red Hen.', 'When the bread was baked, she said, \"Who will eat this bread?\"', '\"I will,\" said the Goose.', '\"I will,\" said the Duck.', '\"No, you won\\'t,\" said the little Red Hen.', '\"I shall eat it myself.', 'Cluck!', 'cluck!\"', 'And she called her chickens to help her.', 'THE GINGERBREAD MAN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time there was a little old woman and a little old man,

him a chocolate jacket, and put\\r\\nraisins on it for buttons; his eyes were made of fine, fat currants; his\\r\\nmouth was made of rose-coloured sugar; and he had a gay little cap of\\r\\norange sugar-candy.', 'When the little old woman had rolled him out, and\\r\\ndressed him up, and pinched his gingerbread shoes into shape, she put\\r\\nhim in a pan; then she put the pan in the oven and shut the door; and\\r\\nshe thought, \"Now I shall have a little boy of my own.\"', 'When it was time for the Gingerbread Boy to be done she opened the oven\\r\\ndoor and pulled out the pan.', 'Out

for crabs and such things.', 'And once, when\\r\\nhe was hunting for crabs, he was so hungry that he put his paw into the\\r\\nwater after a crab without looking first,--which you never should do!', 'The minute he put in his paw, _snap_!--the big Alligator who lives in\\r\\nthe mud down there had it in his jaws.', '\"Oh, dear!\"', 'thought the little Jackal; \"the big Alligator has my paw in\\r\\nhis mouth!', 'In another minute he will pull me down and gobble me up!', 'What\\r\\nshall I do?', 'what shall I do?\"', 'Then he thought, suddenly, \"I\\'ll deceive\\r\\nhim!\"', 'So he put on a very cheerful voice, as if nothing at all were the\\r\\nmatter, and he said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Ho!', 'ho!', 'Clever Mr Alligator!', 'Smart Mr Alligator, to take that old\\r\\nbulrush root for my paw!', 'I hope you\\'ll find it very tender!\"', \"The old Alligator was hidden away beneath the mud and bulrush leaves,\\r\\nand he couldn't see anything.\", 'He thought, \"Pshaw!', 'I\\'ve made a mistake.\"', 'So he opened his mouth and let the little Jackal go.', 'The little Jackal ran away as fast as he could, and as he ran he called\\r\\nout,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr Alligator!', 'Kind Mr Alligator!', '_So_ kind of you to let me\\r\\ngo!\"', 'The old Alligator lashed with his tail and snapped with his jaws, but it\\r\\nwas too late; the little Jackal was out of reach.', 'After this the little Jackal kept away from the river, out of danger.', 'But after about a week he got such an appetite for crabs that nothing\\r\\nelse would do at all; he felt that he must have a crab.', 'So he went down\\r\\nby the river and looked all around, very carefully.', 'He didn\\'t see the\\r\\nold Alligator, but he thought to himself, \"I think I\\'ll not take any\\r\\nchances.\"', 'So he stood still and began to talk out loud to himself.', 'He\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I don\\'t see any little crabs on the land I generally see them\\r\\nsticking out of the water, and then I put my paw in and catch them.', 'I\\r\\nwonder if there are any fat little crabs in the water to-day?\"', 'The old Alligator was hidden down in the mud at the bottom of the river,\\r\\nand when he heard what the little Jackal said, he thought, \"Aha!', 'I\\'ll\\r\\npretend to be a little crab, and when he puts his paw in, I\\'ll make my\\r\\ndinner of him.\"', 'So he stuck the black end of his snout above the water\\r\\nand waited.', 'The little Jackal took one look, and then he said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr Alligator!', 'Kind Mr Alligator!', 'You are _exceedingly_ kind\\r\\nto show me where you are!', 'I will have dinner elsewhere.\"', 'And he ran away\\r\\nlike the wind.', 'The old Alligator foamed at the mouth, he was so angry, but the little\\r\\nJackal was gone.', 'For two whole weeks the little Jackal kept away from the river.', 'Then,\\r\\none day he got a feeling inside him that nothing but crabs could\\r\\nsatisfy: he felt that he must have at least one crab.', 'Very cautiously,\\r\\nhe went down to the river and looked all around.', 'He saw no sign of the\\r\\nold Alligator.', 'Still, he did not mean to take any chances.', 'So he stood\\r\\nquite still and began to talk to himself,--it was a little way he had.', 'He said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"When I don\\'t see any little crabs on the shore, or sticking up out of\\r\\nthe water, I usually see them blowing bubbles from under the water; the\\r\\nlittle bubbles go _puff, puff, puff_, and then they go _pop, pop, pop_,\\r\\nand they show me where the little juicy crabs are, so I can put my paw\\r\\nin and catch them.', 'I wonder if I shall see any little bubbles to-day?\"', 'The old Alligator, lying low in the mud and weeds, heard this, and he\\r\\nthought, \"Pooh!', '_That\\'s_ easy enough; I\\'ll just blow some little\\r\\ncrab-bubbles, and then he will put his paw in where I can get it.\"', 'So he blew, and he blew, a mighty blast, and the bubbles rose in a\\r\\nperfect whirlpool, fizzing and swirling.', \"The little Jackal didn't have to be told who was underneath those\\r\\nbubbles: he took one quick look, and off he ran.\", 'But as he went, he\\r\\nsang,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, Mr

did not like to risk going near the water,\\r\\nso he ate no more crabs.', 'But he found a garden of wild figs, which were\\r\\nso good that he went there every day, and ate them instead of\\r\\nshell-fish.', 'Now the old Alligator found this out, and he made up his mind to have\\r\\nthe little Jackal for supper, or to die trying.', 'So he crept, and\\r\\ncrawled, and dragged himself over the ground to the garden of wild figs.', 'There he made a huge pile of figs under the biggest of the wild fig\\r\\ntrees, and hid himself in the pile.', 'After a while the little Jackal came dancing into the garden, very happy\\r\\nand free from care,--_but_ looking all around.', 'He saw the huge pile of\\r\\nfigs under the big fig tree.', '\"H-m,\" he thought, \"that looks singularly like my friend, the Alligator.', 'I\\'ll investigate a bit.\"', 'He stood quite still and began to talk to himself,--it was a little way\\r\\nhe had.', 'He said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The little figs I like best are the fat, ripe, juicy ones that drop off\\r\\nwhen the breeze blows; and then the wind blows them about on the ground,\\r\\nthis way and that; the great heap of figs over there is so still that I\\r\\nthink they must be all bad figs.\"', 'The old Alligator, underneath his fig pile, thought,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bother the suspicious little Jackal!', 'I shall have to make these figs\\r\\nroll about, so that he will think the wind moves them.\"', 'And straight-way\\r\\nhe humped himself up and moved, and sent the little figs flying,--and\\r\\nhis back showed through.', 'The little Jackal did not wait for a second look.', 'He ran out of the\\r\\ngarden like the wind.', 'But as he ran he called back,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thank you, again, Mr Alligator; very sweet of you to show me where you\\r\\nare; I can\\'t stay to thank you as I should like: good-bye!\"', 'At this the old Alligator was beside himself with rage.', 'He vowed that he\\r\\nwould have the little Jackal for supper this time, come what might.', \"So\\r\\nhe crept and crawled over the ground till he came to the little Jackal's\\r\\nhouse.\", 'Then he crept and crawled inside, and hid himself there in the\\r\\nhouse, to wait till the little Jackal should come home.', 'By and by the little Jackal came dancing home, happy and free from\\r\\ncare,--_but_ looking all around.', 'Presently, as he came along, he saw\\r\\nthat the ground was all raked up as if something very heavy had been\\r\\ndragged over it.', 'The little Jackal stopped and looked.', '\"What\\'s this?', 'what\\'s this?\"', 'he said.', 'Then he saw that the door of his house was crushed at the sides and\\r\\nbroken, as if something very big had gone through it.', '\"What\\'s this?', 'What\\'s this?\"', 'the little Jackal said.', '\"I think I\\'ll\\r\\ninvestigate a little!\"', 'So he stood quite still and began to talk to himself (you remember, it\\r\\nwas a little way he had), but loudly.', 'He said,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"How strange that my little House doesn\\'t speak to me!', \"Why don't you\\r\\nspeak to me, little House?\", 'You always speak to me, if everything is all\\r\\nright, when I come home.', 'I wonder if anything is wrong with my little\\r\\nHouse?\"', 'The old Alligator thought to himself that he must certainly pretend to\\r\\nbe the little House, or the little Jackal would never come in.', 'So he put\\r\\non as pleasant a voice as he could (which is not saying much) and\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hullo, little Jackal!\"', 'Oh!', 'When the little Jackal heard that, he was frightened enough, for\\r\\nonce.', '\"It\\'s the old Alligator,\" he said, \"and if I don\\'t make an end of him\\r\\nthis time he will certainly make an end of me.', 'What shall I do?\"', 'He thought very fast.', 'Then he spoke out pleasantly.', '\"Thank you, little House,\" he said, \"it\\'s good to hear your pretty\\r\\nvoice, dear little House, and I will be in with you in a minute; only\\r\\nfirst I must gather some firewood for dinner.\"', 'Then he went and gathered firewood, and more firewood, and more\\r\\nfirewood; and he piled it all up solid against the door and round the\\r\\nhouse; and then he set fire to it!',

better than play;\\r\\nthey had a lovely, merry, kind mother, who was never too tired to help\\r\\nthem work or watch them play; and they had all the great green country\\r\\nto play in.', 'There were dark, shadowy woods, and fields of flowers, and a\\r\\nriver.', 'And there was a big barn.', 'One of the little girls was named Louisa.', 'She was very pretty, and ever\\r\\nso strong; she could run for miles through the woods and not get tired.', 'She had a splendid brain in her little head; it liked study, and it\\r\\nthought interesting thoughts all day long.', 'Louisa liked to sit in a corner by herself, sometimes, and write\\r\\nthoughts in her diary; all the little girls kept diaries.', 'She liked to\\r\\nmake up stories out of her own head, and sometimes she made verses.', 'When the four little sisters had finished their lessons, and had helped\\r\\ntheir mother wash up and sew, they used to go to the big barn to play;\\r\\nand the best play of all was theatricals.', 'Louisa liked theatricals\\r\\nbetter than anything.', 'They made the barn into a theatre, and the grown-up people came to see\\r\\nthe plays they acted.', 'They used to climb up on the hay-loft for a stage,\\r\\nand the grown people sat in chairs on the floor.', 'It was great fun.', 'One\\r\\nof the plays they acted was _Jack and the Beanstalk_.', 'They had a ladder\\r\\nfrom the floor to the loft, and on the ladder they tied a vine all the\\r\\nway up to the loft, to look like the wonderful beanstalk.', 'One of the\\r\\nlittle girls was dressed up to look like Jack, and she acted that part.', 'When it came to the place in the story where the giant tried to follow\\r\\nJack, the little girl cut down the beanstalk, and down came the giant\\r\\ntumbling from the loft.', 'The giant was made out of pillows, with a great,\\r\\nfierce head of paper, and funny clothes.', 'Another story that they acted was _Cinderella_.', 'They made a wonderful\\r\\nbig pumpkin out of the wheelbarrow, trimmed with yellow paper, and\\r\\nCinderella rolled away in it, when the fairy godmother waved her wand.', 'One other beautiful story they used to play.', \"It was the story of\\r\\n_Pilgrim's

shut?\"', '\"It shuts like this,\" said the Brahmin, pushing it to.', '\"Yes; but I don\\'t see any lock,\" said the little Jackal, \"does it lock\\r\\non the outside?\"', '\"It locks like this,\"

plenty on the other side, if he could only get to them, but he could\\r\\nnot swim.', 'One day he thought of a plan.', 'He went to his friend the Camel, and\\r\\nsaid,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Friend Camel, I know a spot where the sugar-cane grows thick; I\\'ll show\\r\\nyou the way, if you will take me there.\"', '\"Indeed I will,\" said the Camel, who was very fond of sugar-cane.', '\"Where\\r\\nis it?\"', '\"It is on the other side of the river,\" said the little Jackal; \"but we\\r\\ncan manage it nicely, if you will take me on your back and swim over.\"', 'The Camel was perfectly willing, so the little Jackal jumped on his\\r\\nback, and the Camel swam across the river, carrying him.', 'When they were\\r\\nsafely over, the little Jackal jumped down and showed the Camel the\\r\\nsugar-cane field; then he ran swiftly along the river bank, to hunt for\\r\\ncrabs; the Camel began to eat sugar-cane.', 'He ate happily, and noticed\\r\\nnothing around him.', 'Now, you know, a Camel is very big, and a Jackal is very little.', 'Consequently, the little Jackal had eaten his fill by the time the Camel\\r\\nhad barely taken a mouthful.', 'The little Jackal had no mind to wait for\\r\\nhis slow friend; he wanted to be off home again, about his business.', 'So\\r\\nhe ran round and round the sugar-cane field, and as he ran he sang and\\r\\nshouted, and made a great hullabaloo.', 'Of course, the villagers heard him at once.', '\"There is a Jackal in the sugar-cane,\" they said; \"he will dig holes and\\r\\ndestroy the roots; we must go down and drive him out.\"', 'So they came\\r\\ndown, with sticks and stones.', 'When they got there, there was no Jackal\\r\\nto be seen; but they saw the great Camel, eating away at the juicy\\r\\nsugar-cane.', 'They ran at him and beat him, and stoned him, and drove him\\r\\naway half dead.', 'When they had gone, leaving the poor Camel half killed, the little\\r\\nJackal came dancing back from somewhere or other.', '\"I think it\\'s time to go home, now,\" he said; \"don\\'t you?\"', '\"Well, you _are_ a pretty friend!\"', 'said the Camel.', '\"The idea of your\\r\\nmaking such a noise, with your shouting and singing!', 'You brought this\\r\\nupon me.', 'What in the world made you do it?', 'Why did you shout and sing?\"', '\"Oh, I don\\'t know _why_\" said the little Jackal,--\"I always sing after\\r\\ndinner!\"', '\"So?\"', 'said the Camel.', '\"Ah, very well, let us go home now.\"', 'He took the little Jackal kindly on his back and started into the water.', 'When he began to swim he swam out to where the

years ago.', 'A brave little company of pioneers from the Atlantic coast crossed the\\r\\nMississippi River and journeyed across the plains of Central North\\r\\nAmerica in big covered wagons with many horses, and finally succeeded in\\r\\nclimbing to the top of the great Rockies and down again into a valley in\\r\\nthe very midst of the mountains.', 'It was a valley of brown, bare, desert\\r\\nsoil, in a climate where almost no rain falls; but the snow on the\\r\\nmountain-tops sent down little streams of pure water, the winds were\\r\\ngentle, and lying like a blue jewel at the foot of the western hills was\\r\\na marvellous lake of salt water,--an inland sea.', 'So the pioneers settled\\r\\nthere and built themselves huts and cabins for the first winter.', 'It had taken them many months to make the terrible journey; many had\\r\\ndied of weariness and illness on the way; many died of hardship during\\r\\nthe winter; and the provisions they had brought in their wagons were so\\r\\nnearly gone that, by spring, they were living partly on roots, dug from\\r\\nthe ground.', 'All their lives now depended on the crops of grain and\\r\\nvegetables which they could raise in the valley.', 'They made the barren\\r\\nland fertile by spreading water from the little streams over it,--what\\r\\nwe call \"irrigating\"; and they planted enough corn and grain and\\r\\nvegetables for all the people.', 'Every one helped, and every one watched\\r\\nfor the sprouting, with hopes, and prayers, and careful eyes.', 'In good time the seeds sprouted, and the dry, brown earth was covered\\r\\nwith a carpet of tender, green, growing things.', \"No farmer's garden could\\r\\nhave looked better than the great garden of the desert valley.\", 'And from\\r\\nday to day the little shoots grew and flourished till they were all well\\r\\nabove the ground.', 'Then a terrible thing happened.', 'One day, the men who were watering the\\r\\ncrops saw a great number of crickets swarming over the ground at the\\r\\nedge of the gardens nearest the mountains.', 'They were hopping from the\\r\\nbarren places into the young, green crops, and as they settled down they\\r\\nate the tiny shoots and leaves to the ground.', 'More came, and more, and\\r\\never more, and as they came they spread out till they covered a big\\r\\ncorner of the grain field.', 'And still more and more, till it was like an\\r\\narmy of black, hopping, crawling crickets, streaming down the side of\\r\\nthe mountain to kill the crops.', 'The men tried to kill the crickets by beating them down, but the\\r\\nnumbers were so great that it was like beating at the sea.', 'Then they ran\\r\\nand told the terrible news, and all the village came to help.', 'They\\r\\nstarted fires; they dug trenches and filled them with water; they ran\\r\\nwildly about in the fields, killing what they could.', 'But while they\\r\\nfought in one place new armies of crickets marched down the\\r\\nmountain-sides and attacked the fields in other places.', 'And at last the\\r\\npeople fell on their knees and wept and cried in despair, for they saw\\r\\nstarvation and death in the fields.', 'A few knelt to pray.', 'Others gathered round and joined them, weeping.', 'More left their useless struggles and knelt beside their neighbours.', 'At\\r\\nlast nearly all the people were kneeling on the desolate fields praying\\r\\nfor deliverance from the plague of crickets.', 'Suddenly, from far off in the air toward the great salt lake, there was\\r\\nthe sound of flapping wings.', 'It grew louder.', 'Some of the people looked\\r\\nup, startled.', 'They saw, like a white cloud rising from the lake, a flock\\r\\nof sea gulls flying toward them.', 'Snow-white in the sun, with great wings\\r\\nbeating and soaring, in hundreds and hundreds, they rose and circled and\\r\\ncame on.', '\"The gulls!', 'the gulls!\"', 'was the cry.', '\"What does it mean?\"', 'The gulls flew overhead, with a shrill chorus of whimpering cries, and\\r\\nthen, in a marvellous white cloud of outspread wings and hovering\\r\\nbreasts, they settled down over the cultivated ground.', '\"Oh!', 'woe!', 'woe!\"', 'cried the people.', '\"The gulls are eating what the\\r\\ncrickets have left!', 'they will strip root and branch!\"', 'But all at once, someone called out,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, no!', 'See!', 'they are eating the crickets!', 'They are eating only the\\r\\ncrickets!\"', 'It was true.', 'The gulls devoured the crickets in dozens, in hundreds, in\\r\\nswarms.', 'They ate until they were gorged, and then they flew heavily back\\r\\nto the lake, only to come again with new appetite.', 'And when at last they\\r\\nfinished, they had stripped the fields of the army of crickets; and the\\r\\npeople were saved.', 'To this day, in the beautiful city of Salt Lake, which grew out of that\\r\\npioneer village, the little children are taught to love the sea gulls.', 'And when they learn drawing and weaving in the schools, their first\\r\\ndesign is often a picture of a cricket and a gull.', 'THE NIGHTINGALE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA long, long time ago, as long ago as when there were fairies, there\\r\\nlived an emperor in China, who had a most beautiful palace, all made of\\r\\ncrystal.', 'Outside the palace was the loveliest garden in the whole world,\\r\\nand farther away was a forest where the trees were taller than any other\\r\\ntrees in the world, and farther away, still, was a deep wood.', 'And in\\r\\nthis wood lived a little Nightingale.', 'The Nightingale sang so\\r\\nbeautifully that everybody who heard her remembered her song better than\\r\\nanything else that he heard or saw.', 'People came from all over the world\\r\\nto see the crystal palace and the wonderful garden and the great forest;\\r\\nbut when they went home and wrote books about these things they always\\r\\nwrote, \"But the Nightingale is the best of all.\"', 'At last it happened that the Emperor came upon a book which said this,\\r\\nand he at once sent for his Chamberlain.', '\"Who is this Nightingale?\"', 'said the Emperor.', '\"Why have I never heard him\\r\\nsing?\"', 'The Chamberlain, who was a very important person, said, \"There cannot be\\r\\nany such person; I have never heard his name.\"', '\"The book says there is a Nightingale,\" said the Emperor.', '\"I command\\r\\nthat the Nightingale be brought here to sing for me this evening.\"', 'The Chamberlain went out and asked all the great lords and ladies and\\r\\npages where the Nightingale could be found, but not one of them had ever\\r\\nheard of him.', 'So the Chamberlain went back to the Emperor and said,\\r\\n\"There is no such person.\"', '\"The book says there is a Nightingale,\" said the Emperor; \"if the\\r\\nNightingale is not here to sing for me this evening I will have the\\r\\ncourt trampled upon, immediately after supper.\"', 'The Chamberlain did not want to be trampled upon, so he ran out and\\r\\nasked everybody in the palace about the Nightingale.', 'At last, a little\\r\\ngirl who worked in the kitchen to help the cook, said, \"Oh, yes, I know\\r\\nthe Nightingale very well.', 'Every night, when I go to carry scraps from\\r\\nthe kitchen to my mother, who lives in the wood beyond the forest, I\\r\\nhear the Nightingale sing.\"', \"The Chamberlain asked the maid to take him to the Nightingale's home,\\r\\nand many of the lords and ladies followed after.\", 'When they had gone a\\r\\nlittle way, they heard a cow moo.', '\"Ah!\"', 'said the lords and ladies, \"that must be the Nightingale; what a\\r\\nlarge voice for so small a creature!\"', '\"Oh, no,\" said the little girl, \"that is just a cow, mooing.\"', 'A little farther on they heard some bullfrogs, in a swamp.', '\"Surely that\\r\\nis the Nightingale,\" said the courtiers; \"it really sounds like\\r\\nchurch-bells!\"', '\"Oh, no,\" said the little girl, \"those are bullfrogs, croaking.\"', 'At last they came to the wood where the Nightingale was.', '\"Hush!\"', 'said\\r\\nthe little girl, \"she is going to sing.\"', 'And, sure enough, the little\\r\\nNightingale began to sing.', 'She sang so beautifully that you have never\\r\\nin all your life heard anything like it.', '\"Dear, dear,\" said the courtiers, \"that is very pleasant; does that\\r\\nlittle grey bird really make all that noise?', 'She is so pale that I think\\r\\nshe has lost her colour for fear of us.\"', 'The Chamberlain asked the little Nightingale to come and sing for the\\r\\nEmperor.', 'The little Nightingale said she could sing better in her own\\r\\ngreenwood, but she was so sweet and kind that she came with them.', 'That evening the palace was all trimmed with the most beautiful flowers\\r\\nyou can imagine, and rows and rows of little silver bells, that tinkled\\r\\nwhen the wind blew in, and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of wax\\r\\ncandles, that shone like tiny stars.', \"In the great hall there was a gold\\r\\nperch for the Nightingale, beside the Emperor's throne.\", 'When all the people were there, the Emperor asked the Nightingale to\\r\\nsing.', 'Then the little grey Nightingale filled her throat full, and sang.', \"And, my dears, she sang so beautifully that the Emperor's eyes filled up\\r\\nwith tears!\", 'And, you know, emperors do not cry at all easily.', 'So he\\r\\nasked her to sing again, and this time she sang so marvellously that\\r\\nthe tears came out of his eyes and ran down his cheeks.', 'That was a great\\r\\nsuccess.', 'They asked the little Nightingale to sing, over and over again,\\r\\nand when they had listened enough the Emperor said that she should be\\r\\nmade \"Singer in Chief to the Court.\"', \"She was to have a golden perch near\\r\\nthe Emperor's bed, and a little golden cage, and was to be allowed to go\\r\\nout twice every day.\", \"But there were twelve servants appointed to wait on\\r\\nher, and those twelve servants went with her every time she went out,\\r\\nand each of the twelve had hold of the end of a silken string which was\\r\\ntied to the little Nightingale's leg!\", 'It was not so very much fun to go\\r\\nout that way!', 'For a long, long time the Nightingale sang every evening to the Emperor\\r\\nand his court, and they liked her so much that the ladies all tried to\\r\\nsing like her; they used to put water in their mouths and then make\\r\\nlittle sounds like this: _glu-glu-glug_.', 'And when the courtiers met each\\r\\nother in the halls, one would say \"Night,\" and the other would say\\r\\n\"ingale,\" and that was supposed to be conversation.', 'At last, one day, there came a little package to the Emperor, on the\\r\\noutside of which was written, \"The Nightingale.\"', 'Inside was an\\r\\nartificial bird, something like a Nightingale, only it was made of gold,\\r\\nand silver, and rubies, and emeralds, and diamonds.', 'When it was wound\\r\\nup it played a waltz tune, and as it played it moved its little tail up\\r\\nand down.', 'Everybody in the court was filled with delight at the music of\\r\\nthe new nightingale.', 'They made it sing that same tune thirty-three\\r\\ntimes, and still they had not had enough.', 'They would have made it sing\\r\\nthe tune thirty-four times, but the Emperor said, \"I should like to hear\\r\\nthe real Nightingale sing, now.\"', 'But when they looked about for the real little Nightingale, they could\\r\\nnot find her anywhere!', 'She had taken the chance, while everybody was\\r\\nlistening to the waltz tunes, to fly away through the window to her own\\r\\ngreenwood.', '\"What a very ungrateful bird!\"', 'said the lords and ladies.', '\"But it does\\r\\nnot matter; the new nightingale is just as good.\"', \"So the artificial nightingale was given the real Nightingale's little\\r\\ngold perch, and every night the Emperor wound her up, and she sang waltz\\r\\ntunes to him.\", \"The people in the court liked her even better than the old\\r\\nNightingale, because they could all whistle her tunes,--which you can't\\r\\ndo with real nightingales.\", 'About a year after the artificial nightingale came, the Emperor was\\r\\nlistening to her waltz tune, when there was a _snap_ and _whir-r-r_\\r\\ninside the bird, and the music stopped.', 'The Emperor ran to his doctor,\\r\\nbut he could not do anything.', 'Then he ran to his clock-maker, but he\\r\\ncould not do much.', 'Nobody could do much.', 'The best they could do was to\\r\\npatch the gold nightingale up so that it could sing once a year; even\\r\\nthat was almost too much, and the tune was very shaky.', 'Still, the\\r\\nEmperor kept the gold nightingale on the perch in his own room.', 'A long time went by, and then, at last, the Emperor grew very ill, and\\r\\nwas about to die.', 'When it was sure that he could not live much longer,\\r\\nthe people chose a new emperor and waited for the old one to die.', 'The\\r\\npoor Emperor lay, quite cold and pale, in his great big bed, with velvet\\r\\ncurtains and tall candlesticks all about.', 'He was quite alone, for all\\r\\nthe courtiers had gone to congratulate the new emperor, and all the\\r\\nservants had gone to talk it over.', 'When the Emperor woke up, he felt a terrible weight on his chest.', 'He\\r\\nopened his eyes, and there was Death, sitting on his heart.', \"Death had\\r\\nput on the Emperor's gold crown, and he had the gold sceptre in one\\r\\nhand, and the silken banner in the other; and he looked at the Emperor\\r\\nwith his great hollow eyes.\", 'The room was full of shadows, and the\\r\\nshadows were full of faces.', 'Everywhere the Emperor looked, there were\\r\\nfaces.', 'Some were very, very ugly, and some were sweet and lovely; they\\r\\nwere all the things the Emperor had done in his life, good and bad.', 'And\\r\\nas he looked at them they began to whisper.', 'They whispered, \"_Do you\\r\\nremember this?_\" \"_Do you remember that?_\" The Emperor remembered so\\r\\nmuch that he cried out loud, \"Oh, bring the great drum!', 'Make music, so\\r\\nthat I may not hear these dreadful whispers!\"', 'But there was nobody there\\r\\nto bring the drum.', 'Then the Emperor cried, \"You little gold nightingale, can you not sing\\r\\nsomething for me?', 'I have given you gifts of gold and jewels, and kept\\r\\nyou always by my side; will you not help me now?\"', 'But there was nobody\\r\\nto wind the little gold nightingale up, and of course it could not sing.', \"The Emperor's heart grew colder and colder where Death crouched upon it,\\r\\nand the dreadful whispers grew louder and louder, and the Emperor's life\\r\\nwas almost gone.\", 'Suddenly, through the open window, there came a most\\r\\nlovely song.', 'It was so sweet and so loud that the whispers died quite\\r\\naway.', 'Presently the Emperor felt his heart grow warm, then he felt the\\r\\nblood flow through his limbs again; he listened to the song until the\\r\\ntears ran down his cheeks; he knew that it was the little real\\r\\nNightingale who had flown away from him when the gold nightingale came.', 'Death was listening to the song, too; and when it was done and the\\r\\nEmperor begged for more, Death, too, said, \"Please sing again, little\\r\\nNightingale!\"', '\"Will you give me the Emperor\\'s gold crown for a song?\"', 'said the little\\r\\nNightingale.', '\"Yes,\" said Death; and the little Nightingale bought the Emperor\\'s crown\\r\\nfor a song.', '\"Oh, sing again, little Nightingale,\" begged Death.', '\"Will you give me the Emperor\\'s sceptre for another song?\"', 'said the\\r\\nlittle grey Nightingale.', '\"Yes,\" said Death; and the little Nightingale bought the Emperor\\'s\\r\\nsceptre for another song.', 'Once more Death begged for a song, and this time the little Nightingale\\r\\nobtained the banner for her singing.', 'Then she sang one more song, so\\r\\nsweet and so sad that it made Death think of his garden in the\\r\\nchurchyard, where he always liked best to be.', \"And he rose from the\\r\\nEmperor's heart and floated away through the window.\", 'When Death was gone, the Emperor said to the little Nightingale, \"Oh,\\r\\ndear little Nightingale, you have saved me from Death!', 'Do not leave me\\r\\nagain.', 'Stay with me on this little gold perch, and sing to me always!\"', '\"No, dear Emperor,\" said the little Nightingale, \"I sing best when I am\\r\\nfree; I cannot live in a palace.', 'But every night when you are quite\\r\\nalone, I will come and sit in the window and sing to you, and tell you\\r\\neverything that goes on in your kingdom: I will tell you where the poor\\r\\npeople are who ought to be helped,

little Nightingale had flown away, the Emperor felt so well\\r\\nand strong that he dressed himself in his royal robes and took his gold\\r\\nsceptre in his hand.', 'And when the courtiers came in to

leading into the fields.', 'It was on the grass plot that the garden\\r\\nwas to be.', 'A big piece was to be used for wheat and peas and beans, and\\r\\na little piece at the end was to be given to

line of dark earth and green grass come\\r\\nrolling up and turn over, as the knife passed it.', 'She could see that it\\r\\ntook real skill and strength to keep the line even, and to avoid the\\r\\nstones.', 'Sometimes the plough struck a hidden stone, and then the man was\\r\\njerked almost off his feet.', 'But he only laughed, and said, \"Tough piece\\r\\nof land; it will be a lot better next year.\"', 'When he had ploughed, the man went back to his cart and unloaded another\\r\\nfarm implement.', 'This one was like a three-cornered platform of wood,\\r\\nwith a long, curved, strong rake under it.', 'It was called a harrow, and\\r\\nit looked like the diagram on the next page.', 'The man harnessed the horses to it, and then he stood on the platform\\r\\nand drove all over the strip of land.', 'It was fun to watch, but perhaps\\r\\nit was a little hard to do.', \"The man's weight kept the harrow steady,\\r\\nand let the teeth of the rake scratch and cut the ground up, so that it\\r\\ndid not stay in ridges.\", '\"He scrambles the ground, father!\"', 'said Margery.', '\"It needs \\'scrambling,\\'\" laughed her father.', '\"We are going to get more\\r\\nweeds than we want on this fresh soil, and the more the ground is\\r\\nbroken, the fewer there will be.\"', \"[Illustration]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the ploughing and harrowing, the man drove off, and Margery's\\r\\nfather said that he himself would do the rest of the work in the late\\r\\nafternoons, when he came home from business; they could not afford too\\r\\nmuch help, he said, and he had learned to take care of a garden when he\\r\\nwas a boy.\", 'So Margery did not see any more done until the next day.', \"But the next day there was hard work for Margery's father!\", 'Every bit of\\r\\nthat ground had to be broken up still more with a spade, and then the\\r\\nclods which were full of grass-roots had to be taken on a fork and\\r\\nshaken, till the earth fell out; when the grass was thrown to one side.', 'That would not have had to be done if the land had been ploughed in the\\r\\nautumn; the grass would have rotted in the ground, and would have made\\r\\nfood for the plants.', \"Now, Margery's father put the fertiliser on the\\r\\ntop, and then raked it into the earth.\", 'At last, it was time to make the place for the seeds.', 'Margery and her\\r\\nmother helped.', 'Father tied one end of a cord to a little stake, and\\r\\ndrove the stake in the ground at one end of the garden.', 'Then he took the\\r\\ncord to the other end of the garden and pulled it tight, tied it to\\r\\nanother stake, and drove that down.', 'That made a straight line.', 'Then he\\r\\nhoed a trench, a few inches deep, the whole length of the cord, and\\r\\nscattered fertiliser in it.', 'Pretty soon the whole garden was lined with\\r\\nlittle trenches.', '\"Now for the seed,\" said father.', 'Margery ran and brought the seed box.', '\"May I help?\"', 'she asked.', '\"If you watch me sow one row, I think you can do the next,\" said her\\r\\nfather.', 'So Margery watched.', 'Her father took a handful of peas, and, stooping,\\r\\nwalked slowly along the line, letting the seed trickle through his\\r\\nfingers.', 'It was pretty to watch; it made Margery think of a photograph\\r\\nher teacher had, a photograph of a famous picture called \"The Sower.\"', 'Perhaps you have seen it.', 'Putting in the seed was not so easy to do as to watch; sometimes Margery\\r\\ndropped in too much, and sometimes not enough; but her father was\\r\\npatient with her, and soon she did better.', 'They planted peas, beans, spinach, carrots, and parsnips.', \"And Margery's\\r\\nfather made a row of holes, after that, for the tomato plants.\", 'He said\\r\\nthose had to be transplanted; they could not be sown from seed.', 'When the seeds were in the trenches they had to be covered up, and\\r\\nMargery really helped at that.', 'It is fun to do it.', 'You stand beside the\\r\\nlittle trench and walk backward, and as you walk you hoe the loose earth\\r\\nback over the seeds; the same earth that was hoed up you pull back\\r\\nagain.', 'Then you rake very gently over the surface, with the back of a\\r\\nrake, to even it all off.', 'Margery liked it, because now the garden began\\r\\nto look _like_ a garden.', 'But best of all was the work next day, when her own little particular\\r\\ngarden was begun.', \"Father Brown loved Margery and Margery's mother so\\r\\nmuch that he wanted their garden to be perfect, and that meant a great\\r\\ndeal more work.\", 'He knew very well that the old grass would begin to come\\r\\nthrough again on such soil, and that it would make terribly hard\\r\\nweeding.', 'He was not going to have any such thing for his two \"little\\r\\ngirls,\" as he called them.', 'So he gave that little garden particular\\r\\nattention.', 'This is what he did.', 'After he had thrown out all the turf, he shovelled clean earth on to the\\r\\ngarden,--as much as three solid inches of it; not a bit of grass was in\\r\\nthat.', 'Then it was ready for raking and fertilising, and for the lines.', \"The little footpaths were marked out by Father Brown's feet; Margery and\\r\\nher mother laughed well at his actions, for it looked like some kind of\\r\\ndance.\", 'Mr Brown had seen gardeners do it when he was a little boy, and\\r\\nhe did it very nicely: he walked along the sides of the square, with one\\r\\nfoot turned a little out, and the other straight, taking such tiny steps\\r\\nthat his feet touched each other all the time.', 'This tramped out a path\\r\\njust wide enough for a person to walk.', 'The wider path was marked with lines and raked.', 'Margery thought, of course, all the flowers would be put in as the\\r\\nvegetables were; but she found that it was not so.', 'For some, her father\\r\\npoked little holes with his finger; for some, he made very shallow\\r\\ntrenches; and some very small seeds were scattered lightly over the top\\r\\nof the ground.', 'Margery and her mother had taken so much pains in thinking out the\\r\\narrangement of the flowers, that perhaps you will like to hear just how\\r\\nthey designed that garden.', 'At the back were the sweet peas, which would\\r\\ngrow tall, like a screen; on the two sides, for a kind of hedge, were\\r\\nyellow sunflowers; and along the front edge were the gay nasturtiums.', 'Margery planned that, so that she could look into the garden from the\\r\\nfront, but have it shut away from the vegetable patch by the tall\\r\\nflowers on the sides.', 'The two front corners had canariensis in them.', 'Canariensis is a pretty creeper with golden blossoms, very dainty and\\r\\nbright.', \"And then, in little square patches all round the garden, were\\r\\nplanted London pride, blue bachelor's buttons, yellow marigolds, tall\\r\\nlarkspur, many-coloured asters, hollyhocks and stocks.\", \"All these lovely\\r\\nflowers used to grow in our grandmothers' gardens, and if you don't know\\r\\nwhat they look like, I hope you can find out next summer.\", 'Between the flowers and the middle path went the seeds for that\\r\\nwonderful salad garden; all the things Mrs Brown had named to Margery\\r\\nwere there.', 'Margery had never seen anything more wonderful than the\\r\\nlittle round lettuce-seeds.', 'They were so tiny that it did not seem\\r\\npossible that green lettuce leaves could come from them.', 'But they surely\\r\\nwould.', 'Mother and father and Margery were late to supper that evening.', 'But they\\r\\nwere all so happy that it did not matter.', 'The last thing Margery\\r\\nthought of, as she went to sleep at night, was the dear, smooth little\\r\\ngarden, with its funny footpath, and with the little sticks standing at\\r\\nthe ends of the rows, labelled \"lettuce,\" \"beets,\" \"helianthus,\" and so\\r\\non.', '\"I have a garden!', 'I have a garden!\"', \"was Margery's last thought as she\\r\\nwent off to dreamland.\", \"THE LITTLE COTYLEDONS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is another story about Margery's garden.\", \"The next morning after the garden was planted, Margery was up and out at\\r\\nsix o'clock.\", 'She could not wait to look at her garden.', 'To be sure, she\\r\\nknew that the seeds could not sprout in a single night, but she had a\\r\\nfeeling that _something_ might happen at any moment.', 'The garden was just\\r\\nas smooth and brown as the night before, and no little seedlings were in\\r\\nsight.', 'But a very few mornings after that, when Margery went out, she saw a\\r\\nfunny little crack opening up through the earth, the whole length of the\\r\\npatch.', 'Quickly she knelt down on the footpath, to see.', 'Yes!', 'Tiny green\\r\\nleaves, a whole row of them, were pushing their way through the crust!', 'Margery knew what she had put there: it was the radish-row; these must\\r\\nbe radish leaves.', 'She examined them very closely, so that she might\\r\\nknow a radish next time.', 'The little leaves, no bigger than half your\\r\\nlittle-finger nail, grew in twos,--two on each tiny stem; they were\\r\\nalmost round.', 'Margery flew back to her mother, to say that the first seeds were up.', 'And her mother, nearly as excited as Margery, came to look at the little\\r\\ncrack.', 'Each day, after that, the row of radishes grew, till, in a week, it\\r\\nstood as high as your finger, green and sturdy.', 'But about the third day,\\r\\nwhile Margery was stooping over the radishes, she saw something very,\\r\\nvery small and green, peeping above ground, where the lettuce was\\r\\nplanted.', 'Could it be weeds?', 'No, for on looking very closely she saw that\\r\\nthe wee leaves faintly marked a regular row.', 'They did not make a crack,\\r\\nlike the radishes; they seemed too small and too far apart to push the\\r\\nearth up like that.', 'Margery leaned down and looked with all her eyes at\\r\\nthe baby plants.', 'The tiny leaves grew two on a stem, and were almost\\r\\nround.', 'The more she looked at them the more it seemed to Margery that\\r\\nthey looked exactly as the radish looked when it first came up.', '\"Do you\\r\\nsuppose,\" Margery said to herself, \"that lettuce and radish look alike\\r\\nwhile they are growing?', 'They don\\'t look alike when they are on the\\r\\ntable!\"', 'Day by day the lettuce grew, and soon the little round leaves were\\r\\neasier to examine; they certainly were very much like radish leaves.', 'Then, one morning, while she was searching for signs of other seeds,\\r\\nMargery discovered the beets.', 'In irregular patches on the row, hints of\\r\\ngreen were coming.', 'The next day and the next they grew, until the beet\\r\\nleaves were big enough to see.', 'Margery looked.', 'Then she looked again.', 'Then she wrinkled her forehead.', '\"Can we have made a mistake?\"', 'she thought.', '\"Do you suppose we can have\\r\\nplanted _all_ radishes?\"', 'For those little beet leaves were almost round, and they grew two on a\\r\\nstem, precisely like the lettuce and the radish; except for the size,\\r\\nall three rows looked alike.', 'It was too much for Margery.', 'She ran to the house and found her father.', 'Her little face was so anxious that he thought something unpleasant had\\r\\nhappened.', '\"Papa,\" she said, all out of breath, \"do you think we could\\r\\nhave made a mistake about my garden?', 'Do you think we could have put\\r\\nradishes in all the rows?\"', 'Father laughed.', '\"What makes you think such a thing?\"', 'he asked.', '\"Papa,\" said Margery, \"the little leaves all look exactly alike!', 'every\\r\\nplant has just two tiny leaves on it, and shaped the same; they are\\r\\nroundish, and grow out of the stem at the same place.\"', \"Papa's eyes began to twinkle.\", '\"Many of the dicotyledonous plants look\\r\\nalike at the beginning,\" he said, with a little drawl on the big word.', 'That was to tease Margery, because she always wanted to know the big\\r\\nwords she heard.', '\"What\\'s \\'dicotyledonous\\'?\"', 'said Margery, carefully.', '\"Wait till I come home to-night, dear,\" said her father, \"and I\\'ll tell\\r\\nyou.\"', 'That evening Margery was waiting eagerly for him.', 'When her father\\r\\nfinished his supper they went together to the garden, and father\\r\\nexamined the seedlings carefully.', 'Then he pulled up a little radish\\r\\nplant and a tiny beet.', '\"These little leaves,\" he said, \"are not the real leaves of the plant;\\r\\nthey are only little pockets to hold food for the plant to live on till\\r\\nit gets strong enough to push up into the air.', 'As soon as the real\\r\\nleaves come out and begin to draw food from the air, these little\\r\\nsubstitutes wither up and fall off.', 'These two lie folded up in the\\r\\nlittle seed from the beginning, and are full of plant food.', 'They don\\'t\\r\\nhave to be very special in shape, you see, because they don\\'t stay on\\r\\nthe plant after it is grown up.\"', '\"Then every plant looks like this at first?\"', 'said Margery.', '\"No, dear, not every one; plants are divided into two kinds: those which\\r\\nhave two food leaves, like these plants, and those which have only one;\\r\\nthese are called dicotyledonous, and the ones which have but one food\\r\\nleaf are monocotyledonous.', 'Many of the dicotyledons look alike.\"', '\"I think that is interesting,\" said Margery.', '\"I always, supposed the plants were different from the minute they began\\r\\nto grow.\"', '\"Indeed, no,\" said father.', '\"Even some of the trees look like this when\\r\\nthey first come through; you would not think a birch tree could look\\r\\nlike a vegetable or a flower, would you?', 'But it does, at first; it looks\\r\\nso much like these things that in the great nurseries, where trees are\\r\\nraised for forests and parks, the workmen have to be very carefully\\r\\ntrained, or else they would pull up the trees when they are weeding.', 'They have to be taught the difference between a birch tree and a weed.\"', '\"How funny!\"', 'said Margery, dimpling.', '\"Yes, it sounds funny,\" said father; \"but, you see, the birch tree is\\r\\ndicotyledonous, and so are many weeds, and the dicotyledons look so much\\r\\nalike at first.\"', '\"I am glad to know that, father,\" said Margery, soberly.', '\"I believe I\\r\\nshall learn a good deal from living in the country; don\\'t you think so?\"', \"Margery's father took her in his arms.\", '\"I hope so, dear,\" he said; \"the\\r\\ncountry is a good place for little girls.\"', 'And that was all that happened, that day.', 'THE TALKATIVE TORTOISE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce upon a time, a Tortoise lived in a pond with two Ducks, who were\\r\\nher very good friends.', \"She enjoyed the company of the Ducks, because she\\r\\ncould talk with them to her heart's content; the Tortoise liked to talk.\", 'She always had something to say, and she liked to hear herself say it.', 'After many years of this pleasant living, the pond became very low, in a\\r\\ndry season; and finally it dried up.', 'The two Ducks saw that they could\\r\\nno longer live there, so they decided to fly to

her that at last they thought of a way to\\r\\ntake her.', '\"We have thought of a way which will be possible,\" they said,\\r\\n\"if only you can manage to keep still long enough.', 'We will each take\\r\\nhold of one end of a stout stick, and do you take the middle in your\\r\\nmouth; then we will fly up in the air with you and carry you with us.', 'But remember not to talk!', 'If you open your mouth, you are lost.\"', 'The Tortoise said she would not say a word; she would not so much as\\r\\nmove her mouth; and she was very grateful.', 'So the Ducks brought a strong\\r\\nlittle stick and took hold of the ends, while the Tortoise bit firmly on\\r\\nthe middle.', 'Then the two Ducks rose slowly in the air and flew away with\\r\\ntheir burden.', 'When they were above the treetops, the Tortoise wanted to say, \"How high\\r\\nwe are!\"', 'But she remembered, and kept still.', 'When they passed the church\\r\\nsteeple she wanted to say, \"What is that which shines?\"', 'But she\\r\\nremembered, and held her peace.', 'Then they came over the village square,\\r\\nand the people looked up and saw them.', '\"Look at the Ducks carrying a\\r\\nTortoise!\"', 'they shouted; and

will make your fame even greater than it is; the\\r\\nportrait of me is perfect!\"', 'When the courtiers heard this, and saw the friendly hand-shake, their\\r\\njealousy of the artist was beyond bounds.', 'Their one thought was, how\\r\\ncould they safely do something to humiliate him.', 'They dared not pick\\r\\nflaws in the portrait statue, for the prince had declared it perfect.', 'But at last one of them said, with an air of great frankness, \"Indeed,\\r\\nHerr Grupello, the portrait of his Royal Highness is perfect; but permit\\r\\nme to say that the statue of the horse is not quite so successful: the\\r\\nhead is too large; it is out of proportion.\"', '\"No,\" said another, \"the horse is really not so successful; the turn of\\r\\nthe neck, there, is awkward.\"', '\"If you would change the right hind-foot, Herr Grupello,\" said a third,\\r\\n\"it would be an improvement.\"', \"Still another found fault with the horse's tail.\", 'The artist listened, quietly.', 'When they had all finished, he turned to\\r\\nthe prince and said, \"Your courtiers, prince, find a good many flaws in\\r\\nthe statue of the horse; will you permit me to keep it a few days more,\\r\\nto do what I can with it?\"', 'The Elector assented, and the artist ordered a temporary screen to be\\r\\nbuilt around the statue, so that his assistants could work undisturbed.', 'For several days the sound of hammering came steadily from behind the\\r\\nenclosure.', 'The courtiers, who took care to pass that way, often, were\\r\\ndelighted.', 'Each one said to himself, \"I must have been right, really;\\r\\nthe artist himself sees that something was wrong; now I shall have\\r\\ncredit for saving the prince\\'s portrait by my artistic taste!\"', 'Once more the artist summoned the prince and his courtiers, and once\\r\\nmore the statue was unveiled.', 'Again the Elector exclaimed at its beauty,\\r\\nand then he turned to his courtiers, one after another, to see what they\\r\\nhad to say.', '\"Perfect!\"', 'said the first.', '\"Now that the horse\\'s head is in proportion,\\r\\nthere is not a flaw.\"', '\"The change in the neck was just what was needed,\" said the second; \"it\\r\\nis very graceful now.\"', '\"The rear right foot is as it should be, now,\" said a third, \"and it\\r\\nadds so much to the beauty of the whole!\"', 'The fourth said that he considered the tail greatly improved.', '\"My courtiers are much pleased now,\" said the prince to Herr Grupello;\\r\\n\"they think the statue much improved by the changes you have made.\"', 'Herr Grupello smiled a little.', '\"I am glad they are pleased,\" he said,\\r\\n\"but the fact is, I have changed nothing!\"', '\"What do you mean?\"', 'said the prince in surprise.', '\"Have we not heard the\\r\\nsound of hammering every day?', 'What were you hammering at then?\"', '\"I was hammering at the reputation of your courtiers, who found fault\\r\\nsimply because they were jealous,\" said the artist.', '\"And I rather think\\r\\nthat their reputation is pretty well hammered to pieces!\"', 'It was, indeed.', 'The Elector laughed heartily, but the courtiers slunk\\r\\naway, one after another, without a word.', 'PRINCE CHERRY\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once an old king, so wise and kind and true that the most\\r\\npowerful good fairy of his land visited him and asked him to name the\\r\\ndearest wish of his heart, that she might grant it.', '\"Surely you know it,\" said the good king; \"it is for my only son, Prince\\r\\nCherry; do for him whatever you would have done for me.\"', '\"Gladly,\" said the great fairy; \"choose what I shall give him.', 'I can\\r\\nmake him the richest, the most beautiful, or the most powerful prince in\\r\\nthe world; choose.\"', '\"None of those things are what I want,\" said the king.', '\"I want only that\\r\\nhe shall be good.', 'Of what use will it be to him to be beautiful, rich,\\r\\nor powerful, if he grows into a bad man?', 'Make him the best prince in the\\r\\nworld, I beg you!\"', '\"Alas, I cannot make him good,\" said the fairy; \"he must do that for\\r\\nhimself.', 'I can give him good advice, reprove him when he does wrong, and\\r\\npunish him if he will not punish himself; I can and will be his best\\r\\nfriend, but I cannot make him good unless he wills it.\"', 'The king was sad to hear this, but he rejoiced in the friendship of the\\r\\nfairy for his son.', 'And when he died, soon after, he was happy to know\\r\\nthat he left Prince Cherry in her hands.', 'Prince Cherry grieved for his father, and often lay awake at night,\\r\\nthinking of him.', 'One night, when he was all alone in his room, a soft\\r\\nand lovely light suddenly shone before him, and a beautiful vision stood\\r\\nat his side.', 'It was the good fairy.', 'She was clad in robes of dazzling\\r\\nwhite, and on her shining hair she wore a wreath of white roses.', '\"I am the Fairy Candide,\" she said to the prince.', '\"I promised your\\r\\nfather that I would be your best friend, and as long as you live I shall\\r\\nwatch over your happiness.', 'I have brought you a gift; it is not\\r\\nwonderful to look at, but it has a wonderful power for your welfare;\\r\\nwear it, and let it help you.\"', \"As she spoke, she placed a small gold ring on the prince's little\\r\\nfinger.\", '\"This ring,\" she said, \"will help you to be good; when you do\\r\\nevil, it will prick you, to remind you.', 'If you do not heed its warnings\\r\\na worse thing will happen to you, for I shall become your enemy.\"', 'Then\\r\\nshe vanished.', \"Prince Cherry wore his ring, and said nothing to anyone of the fairy's\\r\\ngift.\", 'It did not prick him for a long time, because he was good and\\r\\nmerry and happy.', 'But Prince Cherry had been rather spoiled by his nurse\\r\\nwhen he was a child; she had always said to him that when he should\\r\\nbecome king he could do exactly as he pleased.', 'Now, after a while, he\\r\\nbegan to find out that this was not true, and it made him angry.', 'The first time that he noticed that even a king could not always have\\r\\nhis own way was on a day when he went hunting.', 'It happened that he got\\r\\nno game.', 'This put him in such a bad temper that he grumbled and scolded\\r\\nall the way home.', 'The little gold ring began to feel tight and\\r\\nuncomfortable.', 'When he reached the palace his pet dog ran to meet him.', '\"Go away!\"', 'said the prince, crossly.', 'But the little dog was so used to being petted that he only jumped up on\\r\\nhis master, and tried to kiss his hand.', 'The prince turned and kicked the\\r\\nlittle creature.', 'At the instant, he felt a sharp prick in his little\\r\\nfinger, like a pin prick.', '\"What nonsense!\"', 'said the prince to himself.', '\"Am I not king of the whole\\r\\nland?', 'May I not kick my own dog, if I choose?', 'What evil is there in\\r\\nthat?\"', 'A silver voice spoke in his ear: \"The king of the land has a right to do\\r\\ngood, but not evil; you have been guilty of bad temper and of cruelty\\r\\nto-day; see that you do better to-morrow.\"', 'The prince turned sharply, but no one was to be seen; yet he recognised\\r\\nthe voice as that of Fairy Candide.', 'He followed her advice for a little, but presently he forgot, and the\\r\\nring pricked him so sharply that his finger had a drop of blood on it.', 'This happened again and again, for the prince grew more self-willed and\\r\\nheadstrong every day; he had some bad friends, too, who urged him on, in\\r\\nthe hope that he would ruin himself and give them a chance to seize the\\r\\nthrone.', 'He treated his people carelessly and his servants cruelly, and\\r\\neverything he wanted he felt that he must have.', 'The ring annoyed him terribly; it was embarrassing for a king to have a\\r\\ndrop of blood on his finger all the time!', 'At last he took the ring off\\r\\nand put it out of sight.', 'Then he thought he should be perfectly happy,\\r\\nhaving his own way; but instead, he grew more unhappy as he grew less\\r\\ngood.', 'Whenever he was crossed, or could not have his own way instantly,\\r\\nhe flew into a passion.', 'Finally, he wanted something that he really could not have.', 'This time it\\r\\nwas a most beautiful young girl, named Zelia; the prince saw her, and\\r\\nloved her so much that he wanted at once to make her his queen.', 'To his\\r\\ngreat astonishment, she refused.', '\"Am I not pleasing to you?\"', 'asked the prince in surprise.', '\"You are very handsome, very charming, prince,\" said Zelia; \"but you are\\r\\nnot like the good king, your father; I fear you would make me very\\r\\nmiserable if I were your queen.\"', 'In a great rage, Prince Cherry ordered the young girl to be put in\\r\\nprison; and the key of her dungeon he kept.', 'He told one of his friends,\\r\\na wicked man who flattered him for his own purposes, about the thing,\\r\\nand asked his advice.', '\"Are you not king?\"', 'said the bad friend.', '\"May you not do as you will?', 'Keep the girl in a dungeon till she does as you command, and if she will\\r\\nnot, sell her as a slave.\"', '\"But would it not be a disgrace for me to harm an innocent creature?\"', 'said the prince.', '\"It would be a disgrace to you to have it said that one of your subjects\\r\\ndared disobey you!\"', 'said the courtier.', \"He had cleverly touched the prince's worst trait, his pride.\", \"Prince\\r\\nCherry went at once to Zelia's dungeon, prepared to do this cruel thing.\", 'Zelia was gone.', 'No one had the key save the prince himself; yet she was\\r\\ngone.', 'The only person who could have dared to help her, thought the\\r\\nprince, was his old tutor, Suliman, the only man left who ever rebuked\\r\\nhim for anything.', 'In fury, he ordered Suliman to be put in fetters and\\r\\nbrought before him.', 'As his servants left him, to carry out the wicked order, there was a\\r\\nclash, as of thunder, in the room, and then a blinding light.', 'Fairy\\r\\nCandide stood before him.', 'Her beautiful face was stern, and her silver\\r\\nvoice rang like a trumpet, as she said, \"Wicked and selfish prince, you\\r\\nhave become baser than the beasts you hunt; you are furious as a lion,\\r\\nrevengeful as a serpent, greedy as a wolf, and brutal as a bull; take,\\r\\ntherefore, the shape of those beasts whom you resemble!\"', 'With horror, the prince felt himself being transformed into a monster.', 'He tried to rush upon the fairy and kill her, but she had vanished with\\r\\nher words.', 'As he stood, her voice came from the air, saying, sadly,\\r\\n\"Learn to conquer your pride by being in submission to your own\\r\\nsubjects.\"', 'At the same moment, Prince Cherry felt himself being\\r\\ntransported to a distant forest, where he was set down by a clear\\r\\nstream.', \"In the water he saw his own terrible image; he had the head of a\\r\\nlion, with bull's horns, the feet of a wolf, and a tail like a serpent.\", 'And as he gazed in horror, the fairy\\'s voice whispered, \"Your soul has\\r\\nbecome more ugly than your shape is; you yourself have deformed it.\"', 'The poor beast rushed away from the sound of her words, but in a moment\\r\\nhe stumbled into a trap, set by bear-catchers.', 'When the trappers found\\r\\nhim they were delighted to have caught a curiosity, and they immediately\\r\\ndragged him to the palace courtyard.', 'There he heard the whole court\\r\\nbuzzing with gossip.', 'Prince Cherry had been struck by lightning and\\r\\nkilled, was the news, and the five favourite courtiers had struggled to\\r\\nmake themselves rulers, but the people had refused them, and offered the\\r\\ncrown to Suliman, the good old tutor.', 'Even as he heard this, the prince saw Suliman on the steps of the\\r\\npalace, speaking to the people.', '\"I will take the crown to keep in\\r\\ntrust,\" he said.', '\"Perhaps the prince is not dead.\"', '\"He was a bad king; we do not want him back,\" said the people.', '\"I know his heart,\" said Suliman, \"it is not all bad; it is tainted, but\\r\\nnot corrupt; perhaps he will repent and come back to us a good king.\"', 'When the beast heard this, it touched him so much that he stopped\\r\\ntearing at his chains, and became gentle.', 'He let his keepers lead him\\r\\naway to the royal menagerie without hurting them.', 'Life was very terrible to the prince, now, but he began to see that he\\r\\nhad brought all his sorrow on himself, and he tried to bear it\\r\\npatiently.', 'The worst to bear was the cruelty of the keeper.', 'At last, one\\r\\nnight, this keeper was in great danger; a tiger got loose, and attacked\\r\\nhim.', '\"Good enough!', 'Let him die!\"', 'thought Prince Cherry.', 'But when he saw\\r\\nhow helpless the keeper was, he repented, and sprang to help.', \"He killed\\r\\nthe tiger and saved the keeper's life.\", 'As he crouched at the keeper\\'s feet, a voice said, \"Good actions never\\r\\ngo unrewarded!\"', 'And the terrible monster was changed into a pretty\\r\\nlittle white dog.', 'The keeper carried the beautiful little dog to the court and told the\\r\\nstory, and from then on, Cherry was carefully treated, and had the best\\r\\nof everything.', 'But in order to keep the little dog from growing, the\\r\\nqueen ordered that he should be fed very little, and that was pretty\\r\\nhard for the poor prince.', 'He was often half starved, although so much\\r\\npetted.', 'One day he had carried his crust of bread to a retired spot in the\\r\\npalace woods, where he loved to be, when he saw a poor old woman hunting\\r\\nfor roots, and seeming almost starved.', '\"Poor thing,\" he thought, \"she is even more hungry than I\"; and he ran\\r\\nup and dropped the crust at her feet.', 'The woman ate it, and seemed greatly refreshed.', 'Cherry was glad of that, and he was running happily back to his kennel\\r\\nwhen he heard cries of distress, and suddenly he saw some rough men\\r\\ndragging along a young girl, who was weeping and crying for help.', 'What\\r\\nwas his horror to see that the young girl was Zelia!', 'Oh, how he wished\\r\\nhe were the monster once more, so that he could kill the men and rescue\\r\\nher!', 'But he could do nothing except bark, and bite at the heels of the\\r\\nwicked men.', 'That did not stop them; they drove him off, with blows, and\\r\\ncarried Zelia into a palace in the wood.', 'Poor Cherry crouched by the steps, and watched.', 'His heart was full of\\r\\npity and rage.', 'But suddenly he thought, \"I was as bad as these men; I\\r\\nmyself put Zelia in prison, and would have treated her worse still, if I\\r\\nhad not been prevented.\"', 'The thought made him so sorry and ashamed that\\r\\nhe repented bitterly the evil he had done.', 'Presently a window opened, and Cherry saw Zelia lean out and throw down\\r\\na piece of meat.', 'He seized it and was just going to devour it, when the\\r\\nold woman to whom he had given his crust snatched it away and took him\\r\\nin her arms.', '\"No, you shall not eat it, you poor little thing,\" she\\r\\nsaid, \"for every bit of food in that house is poisoned.\"', 'At the same moment, a voice said, \"Good actions never go unrewarded!\"', 'And instantly Prince Cherry was transformed into a little white dove.', 'With great joy, he flew to the open palace window to seek out his Zelia,\\r\\nto try to help her.', 'But though he hunted in every room, no Zelia was to\\r\\nbe found.', 'He had to fly away, without seeing her.', 'He wanted more than\\r\\nanything else to find her, and stay near her, so he flew out into the\\r\\nworld, to seek her.', 'He sought her in many lands, until one day, in a far eastern country, he\\r\\nfound her sitting in a tent, by the side of an old, white-haired hermit.', 'Cherry was wild with delight.', 'He flew to her shoulder, caressed her hair\\r\\nwith his beak, and cooed in her ear.', '\"You dear, lovely little thing!\"', 'said Zelia.', '\"Will you stay with me?', 'If\\r\\nyou will, I will love you always.\"', '\"Ah, Zelia, see what you have done!\"', 'laughed the hermit.', 'At that\\r\\ninstant, the white dove vanished, and Prince Cherry stood there, as\\r\\nhandsome and charming as ever, and with a look of kindness and modesty\\r\\nin his eyes which had never been there before.', \"At the same time, the\\r\\nhermit stood up, his flowing hair changed to shining gold, and his face\\r\\nbecame a lovely woman's face; it was the Fairy Candide.\", '\"Zelia has\\r\\nbroken your spell,\" she said to the prince, \"as I meant she should, when\\r\\nyou were worthy of her love.\"', \"Zelia and Prince Cherry fell at the fairy's feet.\", 'But with a beautiful\\r\\nsmile she bade them come to their kingdom.', \"In a trice, they were\\r\\ntransported to the prince's palace, where King Suliman greeted them with\\r\\ntears of joy.\", 'He gave back the throne with all his heart, and King\\r\\nCherry ruled again, with Zelia for his queen.', 'He wore the little gold ring all the rest of his life, but never once\\r\\ndid it have to prick him hard enough to make his finger bleed.', 'THE GOLD IN THE ORCHARD\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a farmer who had a fine olive orchard.', 'He was very\\r\\nindustrious, and the farm always prospered under his care.', 'But he knew\\r\\nthat his three sons despised the farm work, and were eager to make\\r\\nwealth fast, through adventure.', 'When the farmer was old, and felt that his time had come to die, he\\r\\ncalled the three sons to him and said, \"My sons, there is a pot of gold\\r\\nhidden in the olive orchard.', 'Dig for it, if you wish it.\"', 'The sons tried to get him to tell them in what part of the orchard the\\r\\ngold was hidden; but he would tell them nothing more.', 'After the farmer was dead, the sons went to work to find the pot of\\r\\ngold; since they did not know where the hiding-place was, they agreed to\\r\\nbegin in a line, at one end of the orchard, and to dig until one of them\\r\\nshould find the money.', 'They dug until they had turned up the soil from one end of the orchard\\r\\nto the other, round the tree-roots and between them.', 'But no pot of gold\\r\\nwas to be found.', 'It seemed as if some one must have stolen it, or as if\\r\\nthe farmer had been wandering in his wits.', 'The three sons were bitterly\\r\\ndisappointed to have all their work for nothing.', 'The next olive season, the olive trees in the orchard bore more fruit\\r\\nthan they had ever given before; the fine cultivating they had had from\\r\\nthe digging brought so much fruit, and of so fine a quality, that when\\r\\nit was sold it gave the sons a whole pot of gold!', 'And when they saw how much money had come from the orchard, they\\r\\nsuddenly understood what the wise father had meant when he said, \"There\\r\\nis gold hidden in the orchard; dig for it.\"', 'MARGARET OF NEW ORLEANS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you ever go to the beautiful city of New Orleans, somebody will be\\r\\nsure to take you down into the old business part of the city, where\\r\\nthere are banks and shops and hotels, and show you a statue which stands\\r\\nin a little square there.', 'It is the statue of a woman, sitting in a low\\r\\nchair, with her arms around a child, who leans against her.', \"The woman is\\r\\nnot at all pretty: she wears thick, common shoes, a plain dress, with a\\r\\nlittle shawl, and a sun-bonnet; she is stout and short, and her face is\\r\\na square-chinned Irish face; but her eyes look at you like your\\r\\nmother's.\", 'Now there is something very surprising about this statue: it was the\\r\\nfirst one that was ever made in America in honour of a woman.', 'Even in\\r\\nEurope there are not many monuments to women, and most of the few are to\\r\\ngreat queens or princesses, very beautiful and very richly dressed.', 'You\\r\\nsee, this statue in New Orleans is not quite like anything else.', 'It is the statue of a woman named Margaret.', 'Her whole name was Margaret\\r\\nHaughery, but no one in New Orleans remembers her by it, any more than\\r\\nyou think of your dearest sister by her full name; she is just Margaret.', 'This is her story, and it tells why people made a monument for her.', 'When Margaret was a tiny baby, her father and mother died, and she was\\r\\nadopted by two young people as poor and as kind as her own parents.', 'She\\r\\nlived with them until she grew up.', 'Then she married, and had a little\\r\\nbaby of her own.', 'But very soon her husband died, and then the baby died,\\r\\ntoo, and Margaret was all alone in the world.', 'She was poor, but she was\\r\\nstrong, and knew how to work.', 'All day, from morning until evening, she ironed clothes in a laundry.', 'And every day, as she worked by the window, she saw the little\\r\\nmotherless children from the orphan asylum, near by, working and\\r\\nplaying about.', 'After a while, there came a great sickness upon the city,\\r\\nand so many mothers and fathers died that there were more orphans than\\r\\nthe asylum could possibly take care of.', 'They needed a good friend, now.', 'You would hardly think, would you, that a poor woman who worked in a\\r\\nlaundry could be much of a friend to them?', 'But Margaret was.', 'She went\\r\\nstraight to the kind Sisters who had the asylum and told them she was\\r\\ngoing to give them part of her wages and was going to work for them,\\r\\nbesides.', 'Pretty soon she had worked so hard that she had some money\\r\\nsaved from her wages.', 'With this, she bought two cows and a little\\r\\ndelivery cart.', 'Then she carried her milk to her customers in the little\\r\\ncart every morning; and as she went, she begged the pieces of food left\\r\\nover from the hotels and rich houses, and brought it back in the cart to\\r\\nthe hungry children in the asylum.', 'In the very hardest times that was\\r\\noften all the food the poor children had.', 'A part of the money Margaret earned went every week to the asylum, and\\r\\nafter a few years that was made very much larger and better.', 'Margaret\\r\\nwas so careful and so good at business that, in spite of her giving, she\\r\\nbought more cows and earned more money.', 'With this, she built a home for\\r\\norphan babies; she called it her baby house.', 'After a time, Margaret had a chance to get a bakery, and then she became\\r\\na bread-woman instead of a milk-woman.', 'She carried the bread just as she\\r\\nhad carried the milk, in her cart.', 'And still she kept giving money to\\r\\nthe asylum.', 'Then the great war came, the Civil War.', 'In all the trouble\\r\\nand sickness and fear of that time, Margaret drove her cart of bread;\\r\\nand somehow she had always enough to give the starving soldiers, and for\\r\\nher babies, beside what she sold.', 'And despite all this, she earned\\r\\nenough so that when the war was over she built a big steam factory for\\r\\nher bread.', 'By this time everybody in the city knew her.', 'The children all\\r\\nover the city loved her; the business men were proud of her; the poor\\r\\npeople all came to her for advice.', 'She used to sit at the open door of\\r\\nher office, in a calico gown and a little shawl, and give a good word to\\r\\neverybody, rich or poor.', 'Then, by and by, one day, Margaret died.', 'And when it was time to read\\r\\nher will, the people found that, with all her giving, she had still\\r\\nsaved a great deal of money, and that she had left every penny of it to\\r\\nthe different orphan asylums of the city,--each one of them was given\\r\\nsomething.', 'Whether they were for white children or black, for Jews,\\r\\nCatholics, or Protestants, made no difference; for Margaret always said,\\r\\n\"They are all orphans alike.\"', 'And just think, dears, that splendid,\\r\\nwise will was signed with a cross instead of a name, for Margaret had\\r\\nnever learned to read or write!', 'When the people of New Orleans knew that Margaret was dead, they said,\\r\\n\"She was a mother to the motherless; she was a friend to those who had\\r\\nno friends; she had wisdom greater than schools can teach; we will not\\r\\nlet her memory go from us.\"', 'So they made a statue of her, just as she\\r\\nused to look, sitting in her own office door, or driving in her own\\r\\nlittle cart.', 'And there it stands to-day, in memory of the great love and\\r\\nthe great power of plain Margaret Haughery, of New

how\\r\\nmuch of them is true.\", 'Ireland is like that.', 'It is so old that even as\\r\\nlong ago as four thousand years it had people who dug in the mines, and\\r\\nknew how to weave cloth and to make beautiful ornaments out of gold, and\\r\\nwho could fight and make laws; but we do not know just where they came\\r\\nfrom, nor exactly how they lived.', \"These people left us some splendid\\r\\nstories about their kings, their fights, and their beautiful women; but\\r\\nit all happened such a long time ago that the stories are mixtures of\\r\\nthings that really happened and what people said about them, and we\\r\\ndon't know just which is which.\", 'The stories are called _legends_.', \"One of\\r\\nthe prettiest legends is the story I am going to tell you about the\\r\\nDagda's harp.\", 'It is said that there were two quite different kinds of people in\\r\\nIreland: one set of people with long dark hair and dark eyes, called\\r\\nFomorians--they carried long slender spears made of golden bronze when\\r\\nthey fought--and another race of people who were golden-haired and\\r\\nblue-eyed, and who carried short, blunt, heavy spears of dull metal.', 'The golden-haired people had a great chieftain who was also a kind of\\r\\nhigh priest, who was called the Dagda.', 'And this Dagda had a wonderful\\r\\nmagic harp.', 'The harp was beautiful to look upon, mighty in size, made of\\r\\nrare wood, and ornamented with gold and jewels; and it had wonderful\\r\\nmusic in its strings, which only the Dagda could call out.', 'When the men\\r\\nwere going out to battle, the Dagda would set up his magic harp and\\r\\nsweep his hand across the strings, and a war song would ring out which\\r\\nwould make every warrior buckle on his armour, brace his knees, and\\r\\nshout, \"Forth to the fight!\"', 'Then, when the men came back from the\\r\\nbattle, weary and wounded, the Dagda would take his harp and strike a\\r\\nfew chords, and as the magic music stole out upon the air, every man\\r\\nforgot his weariness and the smart of his wounds, and thought of the\\r\\nhonour he had won, and of the comrade who had died beside him, and of\\r\\nthe safety of his wife and children.', 'Then the song would swell out\\r\\nlouder, and every warrior would remember only the glory he had helped\\r\\nwin for the king; and each man would rise at the great table, his cup in\\r\\nhis hand, and shout \"Long live the King!\"', \"There came a time when the Fomorians and the golden-haired men were at\\r\\nwar; and in the midst of a great battle, while the Dagda's hall was not\\r\\nso well guarded as usual, some of the chieftains of the Fomorians stole\\r\\nthe great harp from the wall, where it hung, and fled away with it.\", 'Their wives and children and some few of their soldiers went with them,\\r\\nand they fled fast and far through the night, until they were a long way\\r\\nfrom the battlefield.', 'Then they thought they were safe, and they turned\\r\\naside into a vacant castle, by the road, and sat down to a banquet,\\r\\nhanging the stolen harp on the wall.', 'The Dagda, with two or three of his warriors, had followed hard on their\\r\\ntrack.', 'And while they were in the midst of their banqueting, the door\\r\\nwas suddenly burst open, and the Dagda stood there, with his men.', 'Some\\r\\nof the Fomorians sprang to their feet, but before any of them could\\r\\ngrasp a weapon, the Dagda called out to his harp on the wall, \"Come to\\r\\nme, O my harp!\"', \"The great harp recognised its master's voice, and leaped from the wall.\", \"Whirling through the hall, sweeping aside and killing the men who got in\\r\\nits way, it sprang to its master's hand.\", 'And the Dagda took his harp and\\r\\nswept his hand across the strings in three great, solemn chords.', 'The\\r\\nharp answered with the magic Music of Tears.', 'As the wailing harmony\\r\\nsmote upon the air, the women of the Fomorians bowed their heads and\\r\\nwept bitterly, the strong men turned their faces aside, and the little\\r\\nchildren sobbed.', 'Again the Dagda touched the strings, and this time the magic Music of\\r\\nMirth leaped from the harp.', 'And when they heard that Music of Mirth, the\\r\\nyoung warriors of the Fomorians began to laugh; they laughed till the\\r\\ncups fell from their grasp, and the spears dropped from their hands,\\r\\nwhile the wine flowed from the broken bowls; they laughed until their\\r\\nlimbs were helpless with excess of glee.', 'Once more the Dagda touched his harp, but very, very softly.', 'And now a\\r\\nmusic stole forth as soft as dreams, and as sweet as joy: it was the\\r\\nmagic Music of Sleep.', \"When they heard that, gently, gently, the Fomorian\\r\\nwomen bowed their heads in slumber; the little children crept to their\\r\\nmothers' laps; the old men nodded; and the young warriors drooped in\\r\\ntheir seats and closed their eyes: one after another all the Fomorians\\r\\nsank into sleep.\", 'When they were all deep in slumber, the Dagda took his magic harp, and\\r\\nhe and his golden-haired warriors stole softly away, and came in safety\\r\\nto their own homes again.', \"THE TAILOR AND THE THREE BEASTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was once a tailor in Galway, and he started out on a journey to go\\r\\nto the king's court at Dublin.\", 'He had not gone far when he met a white horse, and he saluted him.', '\"God save you,\" said the tailor.', '\"God save you,\" said the horse.', '\"Where are you going?\"', '\"I am going to Dublin,\" said the tailor, \"to build a court for the king\\r\\nand to get a lady for a wife, if I am able to do it.\"', 'For, it seems the\\r\\nking had promised his daughter and a great lot of money to anyone who\\r\\nshould be able to build up his court.', 'The trouble was, that three giants\\r\\nlived in the wood near the court, and every night they came out of the\\r\\nwood and threw down all that was built by day.', 'So nobody could get the\\r\\ncourt built.', '\"Would you make me a hole,\" said the old white garraun, \"where I could\\r\\ngo in to hide whenever the people come to fetch me to the mill or the\\r\\nkiln, so that they won\\'t see me; for they tire me out doing work for\\r\\nthem?\"', '\"I\\'ll do that, indeed,\" said the tailor, \"and welcome.\"', 'He brought his spade and shovel, and he made a hole, and he asked the\\r\\nold white horse to go down into it so that he could see if it would fit\\r\\nhim.', 'The white horse went down into the hole, but when he tried to come\\r\\nup again, he was not able.', '\"Make a place for me now,\" said the white horse, \"by which I can come up\\r\\nout of the hole here, whenever I am hungry.\"', '\"I will not,\" said the tailor; \"remain where you are until I come back,\\r\\nand I\\'ll lift you up.\"', 'The tailor went forward next day, and the fox met him.', '\"God save you,\" said the fox.', '\"God save you,\" said the tailor.', '\"Where are you going?\"', 'said the fox.', '\"I\\'m going to Dublin, to try to make a court for the king.\"', '\"Would you make a place for me where I can hide?\"', 'said the fox.', '\"The\\r\\nrest of the foxes are always beating me, and they will not allow me to\\r\\neat anything with them.\"', '\"I\\'ll do that for you,\" said the tailor.', 'He took his axe and his saw, and he made a thing like a crate, and he\\r\\ntold the fox to get into it so that he could see whether it would fit\\r\\nhim.', 'The fox went into it, and when the tailor had him down, he shut him\\r\\nin.', 'When the fox was satisfied at last that he had a nice place of it\\r\\nwithin, he asked the tailor to let him out, and the tailor answered that\\r\\nhe would not.', '\"Wait there until I come back again,\"

arrived, he engaged workmen and began to build the court.', 'At the\\r\\nend of the day he had the workmen put a great stone on top of the work.', 'When the great stone was raised up, the tailor put some sort of\\r\\ncontrivance under it, that he might be able to throw it down as soon as\\r\\nthe giants came near to it.', 'The workpeople then went home, and the\\r\\ntailor went in hiding behind the big stone.', 'When the darkness of the night was come, he saw the three giants\\r\\narriving, and they began throwing down the court until they arrived at\\r\\nthe place where the tailor was in hiding up above, and one of them\\r\\nstruck a blow with his sledge on the place where he was.', 'The tailor\\r\\nthrew down the stone, and it fell on him and killed him.', 'The other two\\r\\nwent home then and left all of the court that was remaining without\\r\\nthrowing it down, since their companion was dead.', 'The workmen came again the next day, and they were working until night,\\r\\nand as they were going home the tailor told them to put up the big\\r\\nstone on the top of the work, as it had been the night before.', 'They did\\r\\nthat for him, went home, and the tailor went in hiding the same as he\\r\\ndid the evening before.', 'When the people had all gone to rest, the two giants came, and they were\\r\\nthrowing down all that was before them, but as soon as they began, the\\r\\ntailor commenced manoeuvring until he was able to throw down the great\\r\\nstone, so that it fell upon the skull of the giant that was under him,\\r\\nand it killed him.', 'After this there was only the one giant left, and he\\r\\nnever came again until the court was finished.', 'Then when the work was over, the tailor went to the king and told him to\\r\\ngive him his wife and his money, as he had the court finished; and the\\r\\nking said he would not give him any wife until he had killed the other\\r\\ngiant, for he said that it was not by his strength he had killed the two\\r\\ngiants before, and that he would give him nothing now until he killed\\r\\nthe other one for him.', 'Then the tailor said that he would kill the other\\r\\ngiant for him, and welcome; that there should be no delay at all about\\r\\nthat.', 'The tailor went then till he came to the place where the other giant\\r\\nwas, and asked did he want a servant-boy.', 'The giant said he did want\\r\\none, if he could get one who would do everything that he would do\\r\\nhimself.', '\"Anything that you will do, I will do,\" said the tailor.', 'They went to their dinner then, and when they had eaten it, the giant\\r\\nasked the tailor \"would he dare to swallow as much boiling broth as\\r\\nhimself.\"', 'The tailor said, \"I will certainly do that, but you must give\\r\\nme an hour before we commence.\"', 'The tailor went out then, and he got a\\r\\nsheepskin, which he sewed up until he made a bag of it, and he slipped\\r\\nit down under his coat.', 'He came in then and told the giant first to\\r\\ndrink a gallon of the broth himself.', 'The giant drank that up while it\\r\\nwas boiling.', '\"I\\'ll do that,\" said the tailor.', 'He went on until it was\\r\\nall poured into the skin, and the giant thought he had drunk it.', 'The\\r\\ngiant drank another gallon then, and the tailor let another gallon down\\r\\ninto the skin, but the giant thought he was drinking it.', '\"I\\'ll do a thing now that you will not dare to do,\" said the tailor.', '\"You will not,\" said the giant.', '\"What is it you would do?\"', '\"Make a hole and let out the broth again,\" said the tailor.', '\"Do it yourself first,\" said the giant.', 'The tailor gave a prod of the knife, and he let the broth out of the\\r\\nskin.', '\"Now you do that,\" said he.', '\"I will,\" said the giant, giving such a prod of the knife into his own\\r\\nstomach that he killed himself.', 'That is the way the tailor killed the\\r\\nthird giant.', 'He went to the king then, and desired him to send him out his wife and\\r\\nhis money, saying that he would throw down the court again if he did not\\r\\ndo so immediately.', 'They were afraid then that he would throw down the\\r\\ncourt, and they sent the wife to him.', 'When the tailor was a day gone, himself and his wife, they repented and\\r\\nfollowed him to take his wife away from him again.', 'The people who went\\r\\nafter him followed him until they came to the place where the lion was,\\r\\nand the lion said to them, \"The tailor and his wife were here yesterday.', 'I saw them going by, and if you will loose me now, I am swifter than\\r\\nyou, and I will follow them until I overtake them.\"', 'When they heard\\r\\nthat, they released the lion.', 'The lion and the people of Dublin went on, and

crossed the North Sea to\\r\\nsettle in England.', 'In those days men were apt to invent stories to\\r\\naccount for things about them which seemed peculiar, and loving the sea\\r\\nas they did, it is not strange that they had remarked the peculiarity of\\r\\nthe ocean water and had found a reason why it is so different from the\\r\\nwater in the rivers and steams.', 'This is not the only story that has come down to tell us how people of\\r\\nold accounted for the sea being salt.', 'There are many such stories, each\\r\\ndifferent from the other, all showing that the same childlike spirit of\\r\\ninquiry was at work in different places, striving to find an answer to\\r\\nthis riddle of nature.', '*       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nThere sprang from the sons of Odin a race of men who became mighty kings\\r\\nof the earth, and one of these, named Frode, ruled over the lands that\\r\\nare called Denmark.', 'Now about this time were found in Denmark two great millstones, so large\\r\\nthat no one had the strength to turn them.', 'So Frode sent for all the\\r\\nwise men of the land and bade them examine the stones and tell him of\\r\\nwhat use they were, since no one could grind with them.', 'And after the wise men had looked closely at them and read the magic\\r\\nletters which were cut upon their edge, they said that the millstones\\r\\nwere precious indeed, since they would grind out of nothing anything\\r\\nthat the miller might wish.', 'So King Frode sent messengers over the world to find for him two\\r\\nservants who would be strong enough to grind with the millstones, and\\r\\nafter a long, long time his messengers found him two maid-servants, who\\r\\nwere bigger and stronger than anyone in Denmark had ever seen.', 'But no\\r\\none guessed that these were really Giant-Maidens who bore a grudge\\r\\nagainst all of the race of Odin.', 'Directly the Giant-Maidens were brought before Frode, and before they\\r\\nhad rested after their long journey, or satisfied their hunger, he bade\\r\\nthem go to the mill, and grind for him gold and peace and happiness.', '\"They sang and swung\\r\\n      The swift mill stone,\\r\\n      And with loud voice\\r\\n      They made their moan.', '\\'We grind for Frode\\r\\n      Wealth and gold\\r\\n      Abundant riches\\r\\n      He shall behold.\\'\"', 'Presently Frode came into the mill to see that the new servants were\\r\\nperforming their task diligently.', 'And as he watched them from the shadow\\r\\nby the door, the maidens stayed their grinding for a while to rest.', \"The greedy man could not bear to see even an instant's pause, and he\\r\\ncame out of the shadow, and bade them, with harsh words, go on grinding,\\r\\nand cease not except for so long as the cuckoo was silent, or while he\\r\\nhimself sang a song.\", 'Now it was early summer-time, and the cuckoo was\\r\\ncalling all the day and most of the night.', 'So the Giant-Maidens waxed very wroth with King Frode, and as they\\r\\nresumed their labours they sang a song of the hardness of their lot in\\r\\nthe household of this pitiless King.', 'They had been grinding out wealth and happiness and peace, but now they\\r\\nbade the magic stones to grind something very different.', 'Presently, as the great stones moved round and round, Frode, who still\\r\\nstood by, heard one chant in a low, sing-song voice,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I see a fire east of the town--the curlews awake and sound a note of\\r\\nwarning.', 'A host approaches in haste, to burn the dwelling of the king.\"', 'And the next took up her song,--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No longer will Frode sit on his throne, and rule over rings of red gold\\r\\nand mighty millstones.', 'Now must we grind with all our might--and,\\r\\nbehold!', 'red warriors come forth--and revenge, and bloodshed, and ruin.\"', 'Then Frode shook from head to foot in his terror, for he heard the tramp\\r\\nof a mighty host of warriors advancing from the sea.', 'And as he looked\\r\\nfor a way of escape, the braces of the millstones broke with the strong\\r\\ngrinding, and fell in two.', 'And the whole world shook and trembled with\\r\\nthe mighty shock of that breaking.', 'But through the crash and din came the voices of the Giant-Maidens,\\r\\nloudly chanting,--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"We have turned the stone round;\\r\\n      Though weary the maidens,\\r\\n      See what they have ground!\"', 'And that same night a mighty sea-king came up and slew Frode and\\r\\nplundered his city.', 'When he had sacked the city, the sea-king took on board his ship the two\\r\\nGiant-Maidens, and with them the broken millstones.', 'And he bade them\\r\\nbegin at once to grind salt, for of this he had very scanty store.', 'So they ground and ground; and in the middle of the night, being weary,\\r\\nthey asked the sea-king if he had not got salt enough.', 'But the sea-king was hard of heart, like Frode, and he roughly bade them\\r\\ngo on grinding.', 'And the maidens did so, and worked to such effect that\\r\\nwithin a short time the millstones had ground out so much salt that the\\r\\nweight of it began to sink the ship.', 'Down, down it sank, ship and giants\\r\\nand millstones, and in that spot, in the very middle of the ocean, arose\\r\\na whirlpool, from whence the salt is carried north and south, east and\\r\\nwest, throughout the waters of the earth.', 'And that is how the sea became salt.', 'THE CASTLE OF FORTUNE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne lovely summer morning, just as the sun rose, two travellers started\\r\\non a journey.', 'They were both strong young men, but one was a lazy fellow\\r\\nand the other was a worker.', 'As the first sunbeams came over the hills, they shone on a great castle\\r\\nstanding on the heights, as far away as the eye could see.', 'It was a\\r\\nwonderful and beautiful castle, all glistening towers that gleamed like\\r\\nmarble, and glancing windows that shone like crystal.', 'The two young men\\r\\nlooked at it eagerly, and longed to go nearer.', 'Suddenly, out of the distance, something like a great butterfly, of\\r\\nwhite and gold, swept toward them.', 'And when it came nearer, they saw\\r\\nthat it was a most beautiful lady, robed in floating garments as fine as\\r\\ncobwebs and wearing on her head a crown so bright that no one could tell\\r\\nwhether it was of diamonds or of dew.', 'She stood, light as air, on a\\r\\ngreat, shining, golden ball, which rolled along with her, swifter than\\r\\nthe wind.', 'As she passed the travellers, she turned her face to them and\\r\\nsmiled.', '\"Follow me!\"', 'she said.', 'The lazy man sat down in the grass with a discontented sigh.', '\"She has\\r\\nan easy time of it!\"', 'he said.', 'But the industrious man ran after the lovely lady and caught the hem of\\r\\nher floating robe in his grasp.', '\"Who are you, and whither are you\\r\\ngoing?\"', 'he asked.', '\"I am the Fairy of Fortune,\" the beautiful lady said, \"and that is my\\r\\ncastle.', 'You may reach it to-day, if you will; there is time, if you\\r\\nwaste none.', 'If you reach it before the last stroke of midnight, I will\\r\\nreceive you there, and will be your friend.', 'But if you come one second\\r\\nafter midnight, it will be too late.\"', \"When she had said this, her robe slipped from the traveller's hand and\\r\\nshe was gone.\", 'The industrious man hurried back to his friend, and told him what the\\r\\nfairy had said.', '\"The idea!\"', 'said the lazy, man, and he laughed; \"of course, if we had a\\r\\nhorse there would be some chance, but _walk_ all that way?', 'No, thank\\r\\nyou!\"', '\"Then good-bye,\" said his friend, \"I am off.\"', 'And he set out, down the\\r\\nroad toward the shining castle, with a good steady stride, his eyes\\r\\nstraight ahead.', 'The lazy man lay down in the soft grass, and looked rather wistfully at\\r\\nthe far-away towers.', '\"If only I had a good horse!\"', 'he sighed.', 'Just at that moment he felt something warm nosing about at his shoulder,\\r\\nand heard a little whinny.', 'He turned round, and there stood a little\\r\\nhorse!', 'It was a dainty creature, gentle-looking, and finely built, and\\r\\nit was saddled and bridled.', '\"Hello!\"', 'said the lazy man.', '\"Luck often comes when one isn\\'t looking for\\r\\nit!\"', 'And in an instant he had leaped on the horse, and headed him for\\r\\nthe castle of fortune.', 'The little horse started at a fine pace, and in a\\r\\nvery few minutes they overtook the other traveller, plodding along on\\r\\nfoot.', '\"How do you like shank\\'s pony?\"', 'laughed the lazy man, as he passed his\\r\\nfriend.', 'The industrious man only nodded, and kept on with his steady stride,\\r\\neyes straight ahead.', 'The horse kept his good pace, and by noon the towers of the castle stood\\r\\nout against the sky, much nearer and more beautiful.', 'Exactly at noon,\\r\\nthe horse turned aside from the road, into a shady grove on a hill, and\\r\\nstopped.', '\"Wise beast,\" said his rider: \"\\'haste makes waste,\\' and all things are\\r\\nbetter in moderation.', 'I\\'ll follow your example, and eat and rest a bit.\"', 'He

'Everything he wanted was brought to him, and music played\\r\\nwhile fireworks were set off in his honour.', 'The music was so loud that\\r\\nhe awoke.', 'He sat up, rubbing his eyes, and behold, the fireworks were\\r\\nthe very last rays of the setting sun, and the music was the voice of\\r\\nthe other traveller, passing the grove on foot!', '\"Time to be off,\" said the lazy man, and looked about him for the pretty\\r\\nhorse.', 'No horse was to be found.', 'The only living thing near was an old,\\r\\nbony, grey donkey.', 'The man called, and whistled, and looked, but no\\r\\nlittle horse appeared.', 'After a long while he gave it up, and, since\\r\\nthere was nothing better to do, he mounted the old grey donkey and set\\r\\nout again.', 'The donkey was slow, and he was hard to

I\\r\\ncan assure you.', 'How he wished he were in a soft, warm bed, with his\\r\\naching bones comfortable in blankets!', 'The very thought of it made him\\r\\nremember the Castle of Fortune, for he knew there must be fine beds\\r\\nthere.', 'To get to those beds he was even willing to bestir his poor\\r\\nlimbs, so he sat up and felt about him for the donkey.', 'No donkey was to be found.', 'The lazy man crept round and round the spot where he had fallen,\\r\\nscratched his hands on the stumps, tore his face in the briers, and\\r\\nbumped his knees on the stones.', 'But no donkey was there.', 'He would have\\r\\nlaid down to sleep again, but he could hear now the howls of hungry\\r\\nwolves in the woods; that it did not sound pleasant.', 'Finally, his hand\\r\\nstruck against something

opposite mountain came striding a\\r\\nPhilistine warrior, calling out something in a taunting voice; he was a\\r\\ngigantic man, the largest David had ever seen, and he was covered with\\r\\narmour, that shone in the sun: he had a helmet of brass upon his head,\\r\\nand he was armed with a coat of mail, and he had greaves of brass upon\\r\\nhis legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders; his spear was so\\r\\ntremendous that the staff of it was like a weaver's beam, and his shield\\r\\nso great that a man went before him, to carry it.\", '\"Who is that?\"', 'asked David.', '\"It is Goliath, of Gath, champion of the Philistines,\" said the soldiers\\r\\nabout.', '\"Every day, for forty days, he has come forth, so, and challenged\\r\\nus to send a man against him, in single combat; and since no one dares\\r\\nto go out against him alone, the armies cannot fight.\"', '(That was one of\\r\\nthe laws of warfare in those times.)', '\"What!\"', 'said David, \"does none dare go out against him?\"', 'As he spoke, the giant stood still, on the hillside opposite the host\\r\\nof Israel, and shouted his challenge, scornfully.', 'He said, \"Why are ye\\r\\ncome out to set your battle in array?', 'Am I not a Philistine, and ye\\r\\nservants of Saul?', 'Choose you a man, and let him come down to me.', 'If he\\r\\nbe able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants;\\r\\nbut if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our\\r\\nservants, and serve us.', 'I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a\\r\\nman, that we may fight together!\"', 'When King Saul heard these words, he was dismayed, and all the men of\\r\\nIsrael, when they saw the man, fled from him and were sore afraid.', 'David\\r\\nheard them talking among themselves, whispering and murmuring.', 'They were\\r\\nsaying, \"Have ye seen this man that is come up?', 'Surely if anyone killeth\\r\\nhim that man will the king make rich; perhaps he will give him his\\r\\ndaughter in marriage, and make his family free in Israel!\"', 'David heard this, and he asked the men if it were so.', 'It was surely so,\\r\\nthey said.', '\"But,\" said David, \"who is this Philistine, that he should defy the\\r\\narmies of the living God?\"', 'And he was stirred with anger.', 'Very soon, some of the officers told the king about the youth who was\\r\\nasking so many questions, and who said that it was shame upon Israel\\r\\nthat a mere Philistine should defy the armies of the living God.', 'Immediately Saul sent for him.', 'When David came before Saul, he said to\\r\\nthe king, \"Let no man\\'s heart fail because of him; thy servant will go\\r\\nand fight with this Philistine.\"', 'But Saul looked at David, and said, \"Thou art not able to go against\\r\\nthis Philistine, to fight with him, for thou art but a youth, and he has\\r\\nbeen a man of war from his youth.\"', 'Then David said to Saul, \"Once I was keeping my father\\'s sheep, and\\r\\nthere came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock; and I\\r\\nwent out after the lion, and struck him; and delivered the lamb out of\\r\\nhis mouth, and when he arose against me, I caught him by the beard, and\\r\\nstruck him, and slew him!', 'Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear;\\r\\nand this Philistine shall be as one of them, for he hath defied the\\r\\narmies of the living God.', 'The Lord, who delivered me out of the paw of\\r\\nthe lion and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the\\r\\nhand of this Philistine.\"', '\"Go,\" said Saul, \"and the Lord be with thee!\"', 'And he armed David with his own armour,--he put a helmet of brass upon\\r\\nhis head, and armed him with a coat of mail.', 'But when David girded his\\r\\nsword upon his armour, and tried to walk, he said to Saul, \"I cannot go\\r\\nwith these, for I am not used to them.\"', 'And he put them off.', \"Then he took his staff in his hand and went and chose five smooth stones\\r\\nout of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had; and his\\r\\nsling was in his hand; and he went out and drew near to the Philistine.\", 'And the Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man that bore\\r\\nhis shield went before him.', 'And when the Philistine looked about and saw\\r\\nDavid, he disdained him, for David was but a boy, and ruddy, and of a\\r\\nfair countenance.', 'And he said to David, \"Am I a dog, that thou comest to\\r\\nme with a cudgel?\"', 'And with curses he cried out again, \"Come to me, and\\r\\nI will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of\\r\\nthe field.\"', 'But David looked at him, and answered, \"Thou comest to me with a sword,\\r\\nand with a spear, and with a shield; but I come to thee in the name of\\r\\nthe Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast\\r\\ndefied.', 'This day will the Lord deliver thee into my hand, and I will\\r\\nsmite thee, and take thy head from thee, and I will give the carcasses\\r\\nof the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and\\r\\nto the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there\\r\\nis a God in Israel!', 'And all this assembly shall know that the Lord\\r\\nsaveth not with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord\\'s, and he\\r\\nwill give you into our hands.\"', 'And then, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew nigh to meet\\r\\nDavid, David made haste and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.', 'And when he was a little way from him, he put his hand in his bag, and\\r\\ntook from thence a stone, and put it in his sling, and slung it, and\\r\\nsmote the Philistine in the forehead, so that the stone sank into his\\r\\nforehead; and he fell on his face to the earth.', 'And David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and\\r\\ndrew it out of its sheath, and slew him with it.', 'Then, when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.', 'But the army of Israel pursued them, and victory was with the men of\\r\\nIsrael.', \"And after the battle, David was taken to the king's tent, and made a\\r\\ncaptain over many men; and he went no more to his father's house, to\\r\\nherd the sheep, but became a man, in the king's service.\", \"THE SHEPHERD'S SONG\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDavid had many fierce battles to fight for King Saul against the enemies\\r\\nof Israel, and he won them all.\", \"Then, later, he had to fight against the\\r\\nking's own soldiers, to save himself, for King Saul grew wickedly\\r\\njealous of David's fame as a soldier, and tried to kill him.\", 'Twice, when\\r\\nDavid had a chance to kill the king, he forbore to harm him; but even\\r\\nthen, Saul continued trying to take his life, and David was kept away\\r\\nfrom his home as if he were an enemy.', 'But when King Saul died, the people chose David for their king, because\\r\\nthere was no one so brave, so wise, or so faithful to God.', 'King David\\r\\nlived a long time, and made his people famous for victory and happiness;\\r\\nhe had many troubles and many wars, but he always trusted that God would\\r\\nhelp him, and he never deserted his own people in any hard place.', 'After a battle, or when it was a holiday, or when he was very thankful\\r\\nfor something, King David used to make songs, and sing them before the\\r\\npeople.', 'Some of these songs were so beautiful that they have never been\\r\\nforgotten.', 'After all these hundreds and hundred of years, we sing them\\r\\nstill; we call them Psalms.', 'Often, after David had made a song, his chief musician would sing with\\r\\nhim, as the people gathered to worship God.', \"Sometimes the singers were\\r\\ndivided into two great choruses, and went to the service in two\\r\\nprocessions; then one chorus would sing a verse of David's song, and the\\r\\nother procession would answer with the next, and then both would sing\\r\\ntogether; it was very beautiful to hear.\", 'Even now, we sometimes do that\\r\\nwith the songs of David in our churches.', \"One of his Psalms that everybody loves is a song that David made when he\\r\\nremembered the days before he came to Saul's camp.\", 'He remembered the\\r\\ndays and nights he used to spend in the fields with the sheep, when he\\r\\nwas just a shepherd-boy; and he thought to himself that God had taken\\r\\ncare of him just as carefully as he himself used to care for the little\\r\\nlambs.', 'It is a beautiful song; I wish we knew the music that David made\\r\\nfor it, but we only know his words.', 'I will tell it to you now, and then\\r\\nyou may learn it, to say for yourselves.', 'The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.', 'He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me\\r\\n     beside the still waters.', \"He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of\\r\\n     righteousness for his name's sake.\", 'Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of\\r\\n     death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod\\r\\n     and thy staff they comfort me.', 'Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine\\r\\n     enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth\\r\\n     over.', 'Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my\\r\\n     life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE HIDDEN SERVANTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a legend about a hermit who lived long ago.', 'He lived high up on\\r\\nthe mountainside in a tiny cave; his food was roots and acorns, a bit of\\r\\nbread given by a peasant, or a cheese brought by a woman who wanted his\\r\\nprayers; his work was praying, and thinking about God.', 'For forty years\\r\\nhe lived so, preaching to the people, praying for them, comforting them\\r\\nin trouble, and, most of all, worshipping in his heart.', \"There was just\\r\\none thing he cared about: it was to make his soul so pure and perfect\\r\\nthat it could be one of the stones in God's great Temple of Heaven.\", 'One day, after the forty years, he had a great longing to know how far\\r\\nalong he had got with his work,--how it looked to the Heavenly Father.', 'And he prayed that he might be shown a man--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown\\r\\n      To the selfsame measure as his own;\\r\\n      Whose treasure on the celestial shore\\r\\n      Could neither be less than his nor more.\"', 'As he looked up from his prayer, a white-robed angel stood in the path\\r\\nbefore him.', 'The hermit bowed before the messenger with great gladness,\\r\\nfor he knew that his wish was answered.', '\"Go to the nearest town,\" the\\r\\nangel said, \"and there, in the public square, you will find a mountebank\\r\\n(a clown) making the people laugh for money.', 'He is the man you seek; his\\r\\nsoul has grown to the selfsame stature as your own; his treasure on the\\r\\ncelestial shore is neither less than yours nor more.\"', 'When the angel had faded from sight, the hermit bowed his head again,\\r\\nbut this time with great sorrow and fear.', 'Had his forty years of prayer\\r\\nbeen a terrible mistake, and was his soul indeed like a clown, fooling\\r\\nin the market-place?', 'He knew not what to think.', 'Almost he hoped he\\r\\nshould not find the man, and could believe that he had dreamed the angel\\r\\nvision.', 'But when he came, after a long, tiring walk to the village, and\\r\\nthe square, alas!', 'there was the clown, doing his silly tricks for the\\r\\ncrowd.', 'The hermit stood and looked at him with terror and sadness, for he felt\\r\\nthat he was looking at his own soul.', 'The face he saw was thin and tired,\\r\\nand though it kept a smile or a grin for the people, it seemed very sad\\r\\nto the hermit.', \"Soon the man felt the hermit's eyes; he could not go on\\r\\nwith his tricks.\", \"And when he had stopped and the crowd had left, the\\r\\nhermit went and drew the man aside to a place where they could rest; for\\r\\nhe wanted more than anything else on earth to know what the man's soul\\r\\nwas like, because what it was, his was.\", 'So, after a little, he asked the clown, very gently, what his life was,\\r\\nwhat it had been.', 'And the clown answered, very sadly, that it was just\\r\\nas it looked,--a life of foolish tricks, for that was the only way of\\r\\nearning his bread that he knew.', '\"But have you never been anything different?\"', 'asked the hermit,\\r\\npainfully.', \"The clown's head sank in his hands.\", '\"Yes, holy father,\" he said, \"I have\\r\\nbeen something else.', 'I was a thief!', 'I once belonged to the most wicked\\r\\nband of mountain robbers that ever tormented the land, and I was as\\r\\nwicked as the worst.\"', 'Alas!', 'The hermit felt that his heart was breaking.', 'Was this how he\\r\\nlooked to the Heavenly Father--like a thief, a cruel mountain robber?', 'He\\r\\ncould hardly speak, and the tears streamed from his old eyes, but he\\r\\ngathered strength to ask one more question.', '\"I beg you,\" he said, \"if\\r\\nyou have ever done a single good deed in your life, remember it now, and\\r\\ntell it to me\"; for he thought that even one good deed would save him\\r\\nfrom utter despair.', '\"Yes, one,\" the clown said, \"but it was so small, it is not worth\\r\\ntelling; my life has been worthless.\"', '\"Tell me that one!\"', 'pleaded the hermit.', '\"Once,\" said the man, \"our band broke into a convent garden and stole\\r\\naway one of the nuns, to sell as a slave or to keep for a ransom.', 'We\\r\\ndragged her with us over the rough, long way to our mountain camp, and\\r\\nset a guard over her for the night.', 'The poor thing prayed to us so\\r\\npiteously to let her go!', 'And as she begged, she looked from one hard\\r\\nface to another, with trusting, imploring eyes, as if she could not\\r\\nbelieve men could be really bad.', 'Father, when her eyes met mine\\r\\nsomething pierced my heart!', 'Pity and shame leaped up, for the first\\r\\ntime, within me.', 'But I made my face as hard and cruel as the rest, and\\r\\nshe turned away, hopeless.', '\"When all was dark and still, I stole like a cat to where she lay bound.', \"I put my hand on her wrist and whispered, 'Trust me, and I will take you\\r\\nsafely home.'\", 'I cut her bonds with my knife, and she looked at me to\\r\\nshow that she trusted.', 'Father, by terrible ways that I knew, hidden from\\r\\nthe others, I took her safe to the convent gate.', 'She knocked; they\\r\\nopened; and she slipped inside.', \"And, as she left me, she turned and\\r\\nsaid, 'God will remember.'\", '\"That was all.', 'I could not go back to the old bad life, and I had never\\r\\nlearned an honest way to earn my bread.', 'So I became a clown, and must be\\r\\na clown until I die.\"', '\"No!', 'no!', 'my son,\" cried the hermit, and now his tears were tears of joy.', '\"God has remembered; your soul is in his sight even as mine, who have\\r\\nprayed and preached for forty years.', 'Your treasure waits for you on the\\r\\nheavenly shore just as mine does.\"', '\"As _yours_?', 'Father, you mock me!\"', 'said the clown.', \"But when the hermit told him the story of his prayer and the angel's\\r\\nanswer, the poor clown was transfigured with joy, for he knew that his\\r\\nsins were forgiven.\", 'And when the hermit went home to his mountain, the\\r\\nclown went with him.', 'He, too, became a hermit, and spent his time in\\r\\npraise and prayer.', 'Together they lived, and worked, and helped the poor.', 'And when, after\\r\\ntwo years, the man who had been a clown died, the hermit felt that he\\r\\nhad lost a brother more holy than himself.', 'For ten years more the hermit lived in his mountain hut, thinking always\\r\\nof God, fasting and praying, and doing no least thing that was wrong.', 'Then, one day, the wish once more came, to know how his work was\\r\\ngrowing, and once more he prayed that he might see a being--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown\\r\\n      To the selfsame measure as his own;\\r\\n      Whose treasure on the celestial shore\\r\\n      Could neither be less than his nor more.\"', 'Once more his prayer was answered.', 'The angel came to him, and told him\\r\\nto go to a certain village on the other side of the mountain, and to a\\r\\nsmall farm in it, where two women lived.', \"In them he should find two\\r\\nsouls like his own, in God's sight.\", 'When the hermit came to the door of the little farm, the two women who\\r\\nlived there were overjoyed to see him, for everyone loved and honoured\\r\\nhis name.', 'They put a chair for him on the cool porch, and brought food\\r\\nand drink.', 'But the hermit was too eager to wait.', 'He longed greatly to\\r\\nknow what the souls of the two women were like, and from their looks he\\r\\ncould see only that they were gentle and honest.', 'One was old, and the\\r\\nother of middle age.', 'Presently he asked them about their lives.', 'They told him the little\\r\\nthere was to tell: they had worked hard always, in the fields with their\\r\\nhusbands, or in the house; they had many children; they had seen hard\\r\\ntimes,--sickness, sorrow; but they had never despaired.', '\"But what of your good deeds,\" the hermit asked,--\"what have you done\\r\\nfor God?\"', '\"Very little,\" they said, sadly, for they were too poor to give much.', 'To\\r\\nbe sure, twice every year, when they killed a sheep for food, they gave\\r\\nhalf to their poorer neighbours.', '\"That is very good, very faithful,\" the hermit said.', '\"And is there any\\r\\nother good deed you have done?\"', '\"Nothing,\" said the older woman, \"unless, unless--it might be called a\\r\\ngood deed----\" She looked at the younger woman, who smiled back at her.', '\"What?\"', 'said the hermit.', 'Still the woman hesitated; but at last she said, timidly, \"It is not\\r\\nmuch to tell, father, only this, that it is twenty years since my\\r\\nsister-in-law and I came to live together in the house; we have brought\\r\\nup our families here; and in all the twenty years there has never been a\\r\\ncross word between us, or a look that was less than kind.\"', 'The hermit bent his head before the two women, and gave thanks in his\\r\\nheart.', '\"If my soul is as these,\" he said, \"I am blessed indeed.\"', \"And suddenly a great light came into the hermit's mind, and he saw how\\r\\nmany ways there are of serving God.\", \"Some serve him in churches and in\\r\\nhermits' cells, by praise and prayer; some poor souls who have been very\\r\\nwicked turn from their wickedness with sorrow, and serve him with\\r\\nrepentance; some live faithfully and gently in humble homes, working,\\r\\nbringing up children, keeping kind and cheerful; some bear pain\\r\\npatiently, for His sake.\", 'Endless, endless ways there are, that only the\\r\\nHeavenly Father sees.', 'And so, as the hermit climbed the mountain again, he thought,--\\r\\n\\r\\n     \"As he saw the star-like glow\\r\\n      Of light, in the cottage windows far,\\r\\n      How many God\\'s hidden servants are!\"', 'LITTLE GOTTLIEB\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross the North Sea, in a country called Germany, lived a little boy\\r\\nnamed Gottlieb.',

would\\r\\ndo for his dear mother when he grew to be a man, and she was comforted\\r\\nas she looked upon her boy, and the thought that she was working for him\\r\\noften gave strength to her tired fingers.\", 'But one night Gottlieb saw that his mother was more than usually\\r\\ntroubled.', 'Every now and then she would sigh, and a tear would trickle\\r\\ndown her cheek.', 'The little boy had grown quick to read these signs of\\r\\ndistress, and he thought, \"Christmas will be here soon, and dear mother\\r\\nis thinking of what a sad time it will be.\"', 'What would Gottlieb have given to be able to comfort his mother!', 'He\\r\\ncould only sit and brood, while his young heart swelled and a lump rose\\r\\nin his throat at the thought that he could do nothing.', 'Presently, however, a

'Our home is\\r\\nso mean and small.\"', 'It seemed foolish to hope, but a boy is not long\\r\\ncast down, and as Gottlieb sat dreaming, a happy inspiration came to\\r\\nhim.', 'Stealing softly from the room he took paper and pen, for he had\\r\\nlearnt to write, and spelt out, word after word, a letter which he\\r\\naddressed to the Christ Child.', 'You may be sure that the postman was puzzled what to do with this letter\\r\\nwhen he sorted it out of the heap in the letter-box.', 'Perhaps the\\r\\nBurgomaster would know the right thing to do?', 'So the postman took the\\r\\nletter to the great burly man who lived in the big house and wore a gold\\r\\nchain round his neck.', 'The Burgomaster opened the envelope, and as he\\r\\nread the letter written in the trembling hand of a child,

very early.', 'But others\\r\\nwere up before him, for, to his surprise, he saw a strange gentleman\\r\\nwith his mother.', 'His wondering eyes soon perceived other unusual\\r\\nobjects, for the
